## Foreword Gazing at Ice 凝视冰

Anna Kavan’s Ice is a book like the moon is the moon. There’s only one. It’s cold and white, and it stares back, both defiant and impassive, static and frantically on the move, marked by phases, out of reach. It may even seem to be following you. It is a book that hides, and glints, like “the girl” who is at the center of its stark, fable-like tableau of catastrophe, pursuit, and repetition-compulsion. The tale might seem simple: a desperate love triangle played out in a world jarred into eco-catastrophe by political and scientific crimes. The narrator, whose resolute search for the girl might appear at first benign or even heroic, nonetheless slowly converges with the personality and motives of the sadistic, controlling “warden,” who is the book’s antagonist and the narrator’s double. Though Ice is always lucid and direct, nothing in it is simple, and it gathers to itself the properties of both a labyrinth and a mirror.  
安娜·卡万的《冰》就像月亮是月亮一样独特。它冰冷而洁白，既藐视又冷漠，静止却又狂乱地移动，有着自己的周期，遥不可及。它甚至似乎在追随着你。这是一部扑朔迷离的书，正如书中那个处于悲剧性、寓言般的画面中心的“女孩”一样。位于追逐和重复-强迫场景的中心。故事看似简单：在一个因政治和科学犯罪而陷入生态灾难的世界里，上演了一场绝望的三角恋。叙述者坚定不移地寻找女孩，起初可能是善意的，甚至是英雄式的，但慢慢地，他的性格和动机与虐待狂、控制欲极强的 "典狱长 "趋于一致，后者是本书的反面人物，也是叙述者的替身。虽然《冰》始终清晰直白，但其中的一切都不简单，它本身就如同镜子组成的迷宫一般。

Like the girl, and like the book’s author, Ice attracts fascination and would-be sponsors. Published in 1967, the book has been introduced by Brian Aldiss, Christopher Priest, Anaïs Nin (whose introduction for the first edition was rejected by Kavan), and now myself. Ice has also generated admiring comments by Doris Lessing and L. P. Hartley, and critical appraisals by L. Timmel Duchamp, Elizabeth Young, and Kate Zambreno—and Kavan has already been the subject of two biographies. Perhaps, given the comparison—and since the brittle, damaged, entrancing “girl” hardly thrives in the enclosures devised for her by the narrator and the warden—you should probably suspect all our motives and go past these words, to the pages of Ice itself.  
就像这个女孩和这本书的作者一样，《冰》吸引着人们的目光和潜在的赞助者。该书出版于 1967 年，布莱恩·阿尔迪斯、克里斯托弗·普利斯特、安娜·宁（她为第一版撰写的序言被卡文拒绝）以及现在的我都曾为其撰写序言。多丽丝-莱辛（Doris Lessing）和 L. P. 哈特利（L. P. Hartley）也对《冰》赞赏有加，L. 蒂梅尔-杜尚（L. Timmel Duchamp）、伊丽莎白-杨（Elizabeth Young）和凯特-赞布雷诺（Kate Zambreno）也对其进行了批评性评价，卡万已经成为两本传记的主题。也许，有鉴于此，且由于这个易碎、受损、迷人的 "女孩 "很难在叙述者和典狱长为她设计的封闭环境中健康成长，你也许应该怀疑我们所有的动机，越过这些文字，去阅读《冰》本身。  

I first located Ice in a used bookstore, in its first American edition, published by Doubleday after Kavan’s death and introduced by Aldiss, who called it science fiction. This was during the time in my reading life when I was trying so hard to find something more like Philip K. Dick and J. G. Ballard and a handful of other things (including certain of Aldiss’s own books, like Report on Probability A). But Kavan’s Ice wasn’t more of anything. I doubt it helps for it to be categorized as science fiction, or to be categorized at all. Even given Anna Kavan’s remarkable life story, and amid her shelf of coolly anguished fiction, Ice stands alone.  
我第一次遇见《冰》是在一所旧书店里发现了它的在美第一版，由道布尔戴出版社在安娜·卡万死后出版，由Aldiss作序，他称其为科幻小说。当时我正拼命搜寻类似 菲利普K迪克 和 J.G.巴拉德 诸如此类（包括aldiss自己的书 例如概率A的报告）的作家。但卡万的《冰》并不是如此。我怀疑它是否该被归类为科幻小说，也许它根本就不该被归类。即使考虑到安娜·卡万非凡的人生经历，以及她写过的冷峻愤懑的小说作品，《冰》依然是独一无二的。

Kavan wasn’t her real name—or perhaps I should say it wasn’t her first name. Born Helen Woods to an upper-class British family, then twice miserably married to older alcoholics, she published several novels under her first married name, Helen Ferguson. From these books, which were precise and despairing, if conventional by the standard of her later writing, she seized up for her self-invention the name of her own autobiographical character: Anna Kavan. The details of her long traipse through wartime exile, multiple suicide attempts, psychiatric incarcerations, and decades of heroin addiction could fill books; Kavan filled sixteen novels with them, though her preference was to sublimate autobiography into pensive, dislocated, and somewhat numbed tableaux.  
卡万不是她的真名，或许我应该说这不是她最初名字。她出生于英国上流社会家庭，原名海伦·伍兹，后来两次不幸嫁给了年长的酗酒者，她用婚后的名字海伦·弗格森的出版了几部小说。虽然这些书按照她后期作品的标准来看比较传统，但它们精准而绝望。从这些书中，她为自己选取了她自传性角色的名字：安娜·卡文。她经历了战时流亡、多次自杀未遂、精神病院监禁以及数十年海洛因成瘾等漫长的经历，这些细节可以写满一本书；而卡万用这些细节写满了 16 部小说，不过她更喜欢将自传升华为沉思、错位和有些麻木的表象。

The frozen disaster overtaking the planet in Ice evokes that cold-war, bomb-dreading, postwar twentieth century we still, in many ways, live inside; it echoes images as popular as episodes of Rod Serling’s Twilight Zone or Kurt Vonnegut’s Cat’s Cradle. The presentation is scattered with scenes of war, civil unrest, and collective societal dysfunction, both vivid and persuasive. During World War II Kavan journeyed by steamer slowly from New Zealand to various ports, including New York, and at last returning to England. A realistic novelist might have made some epic like Olivia Manning’s Balkan and Levant trilogies from this, but Kavan wasn’t a maker of epics and was accompanied not by a colorful husband but by her own violent solitude. A crushed-down and imagistic epic of flight may lurk in the interstices of Ice, in fact. Yet as in Kafka, Poe, Kōbō Abe, and Ishiguro’s The Unconsoled, the essential disturbance resides in an inextricable interplay between inner and outer worlds.  
在《冰》中，冰封的灾难笼罩着整个星球，让人联想到那个冷战时期、炸弹肆虐、战后的二十世纪，在很多方面，我们仍然生活在其中；这与罗德-瑟林（Rod Serling）的《阴阳魔界》（Twilight Zone）和库尔特-冯内古特（Kurt Vonnegut）的《猫的摇篮》（Cat's Cradle）中的形象如出一辙。作品中散布着战争、内乱和集体社会功能失调的场景，既生动又有说服力。二战期间，卡万乘坐蒸汽船从新西兰缓缓驶向包括纽约在内的多个港口，最后返回英国。如果是现实主义小说家，或许会以此创作出像奥利维亚-曼宁（Olivia Manning）的《巴尔干三部曲》（Balkanand Levanttrilogies）那样的史诗，但卡万不是史诗的创作者，陪伴她的不是多姿多彩的丈夫，而是她自己的暴力孤独。事实上，在《冰》的夹缝中可能潜藏着一部被碾碎的、充满想象力的逃亡史诗。然而，正如卡夫卡、爱伦·坡、安部公房和石黑一雄的《无可慰藉》一样，本质上的不安存在于内心世界和外部世界之间不可分割的相互作用之中。

Kavan’s commitment to subjectivity was absolute, but in this, her greatest novel, she manages it by disassociation. If “the girl” is in some way a figure of Kavan’s own vulnerability, she’s also a cypher, barely glimpsed, and as exasperating as she is pitiable. It’s been suggested that the “ice” in Ice translates to a junkie’s relationship to her drug, yet the book is hardly reducible to this or any other form of allegory. Heroin may be integral to the book, hiding everywhere in plain sight and yet also beside the point. The drama of damage and endurance in Ice plays out in an arena of dire necessity and, somehow simultaneously, anomic, dispassionate curiosity.  
卡万致力于表达主观性，但在这部她最伟大的小说中，她却通过分离来实现这点。如果说 "女孩 "在某种程度上是卡文自身脆弱的写照，那么她也是一个难以窥见的隐喻，既令人恼火，又令人怜悯。有人认为，《冰》中的 "冰 "指的是瘾君子与毒品的关系，但这本书很难归结为这种或其他形式的寓言。海洛因可能是这本书不可或缺的一部分，它无处不在地隐藏在人们的视线中，但也是无关紧要的。《冰》中关于伤害和忍耐的戏剧性场面，既是迫不得已的，同时又是原子式的、冷静的好奇心。

What makes this not only possible, but also riveting and unforgettable, is Kavan’s meticulous, compacted style. The book has the velocity of a thriller yet the causal slippages associated with high modernist writing like Beckett’s or Kafka’s. The whole presentation is dreamlike, yet even that surface is riven by dream sequences, and by anomalous ruptures in point-of-view and narrative momentum. At times this gives the reader the sensation that Ice works like a collage or mashup; perhaps William Burroughs has been given a go at it with his scissors and paste pot. By the end, however, one feels at the mercy of an absolutely precise and merciless prose machine, one simply uninterested in producing the illusion of cause and effect. In the place of what’s called “plot,” Kavan offers up a recursive system, an index of reaction points as unsettling and neatly tailored as a sheaf of Rorschach blots. The book’s nearest cousins, it seems to me, are Crash, Ballard’s most narratively discontinuous and imagistic book, or cinematic contemporaries like Godard’s Alphaville (released two years before Ice but not an influence, probably, on a book in the making many years earlier) and Alain Resnais’s Last Year at Marienbad (from 1961, and Kavan was an admirer of its screenwriter, the French novelist Alain Robbe-Grillet). It’ll stick around, as those have, and it may even cut deeper.  
卡万细致、紧凑的文风不仅使这一切成为可能，而且令人目不暇接、难以忘怀。这本书既有着惊悚小说的速度感又有着与贝克特或卡夫卡等高度现代主义写作样式的因果错位。整部作品呈现出梦幻般的效果，但即使是这种表面效果，也被梦境、视角和叙事动力的异常断裂所破坏。有时，读者会觉得《冰》像是拼贴画或混搭画；或许威廉-巴勒斯（William Burroughs）也曾用他的剪刀和浆糊壶尝试过。然而，到了最后，人们会觉得自己受到了一台绝对精确、无情的散文机器的摆布，而这台机器根本不屑于制造因果关系的假象。在所谓 "情节 "的位置上，卡文提供了一个递归系统，一个反应点索引，就像一沓罗夏墨渍测验一样令人不安而又整齐划一。在我看来，这本书的近亲是《撞车》（Crash）-- 巴拉德叙事最不连续、想象力最丰富的作品，或者是戈达尔的《阿尔法维尔》（Alphaville）（比《冰》早两年上映，但对多年前就在创作中的这本书可能没有影响）和阿兰-雷奈斯的《去年在马里昂巴德》（Last Year at Marienbad，1961 年上映，卡万是该片编剧、法国小说家阿兰-罗布-格里莱（Alain Robbe-Grillet）的崇拜者）等同时代电影作品。就像那些电影一样，它也会继续存在，甚至会更加深刻。
