## FOUR

The signed permits arrived the next day. The warden had initialed an additional sentence saying that I was to receive every assistance. This impressed the café proprietor, and I left it to him to circulate the message.  
第二天签署的许可证就送到了。典狱长在上面签了字，并额外加了一句说我将得到一切帮助。这让咖啡馆老板印象深刻，我让他来传达这个消息。

I began making notes on the town: my performance had to be convincing and thorough. I had sometimes thought vaguely of writing about the fascinating singing lemurs; now I had a perfect opportunity to describe them before the memory faded. Each day I wrote a little about my surroundings and a lot more on the other subject. There was nothing else to do, I would have been bored without this occupation, which became an absorbing interest and kept me busy for hours. The time passed surprisingly fast. In some ways I was better off than I had been at home. It was exceedingly cold, but I was warm in my room, having organized a daily supply of logs for the stove. No fuel problem existed here, close to these great forests. To think of the ice coming nearer all the time was very disturbing. But for the present the harbor remained open, occasional ships came and went. From these I sometimes managed to obtain a few delicacies to supplement my meals at the café, which were ample, but lacking in variety. I had arranged for my food to be served in a sort of alcove off the main room, where I was out of the noise and smoke and had a certain amount of privacy.  
我开始对小镇进行记录：我的表现必须既有说服力又详尽彻底。我有时模糊地想过写一写迷人的唱歌狐猴，现在正好有机会在记忆模糊之前描述它们。每天我会写一些关于周围环境的内容，更详细地记录其他的主题。除此之外，我别无他事，如果没有这个工作，我会觉得无聊，这项任务变成了一种吸引人的兴趣，让我忙了好几个小时。时间过得出奇地快。在某些方面，我现在的生活甚至比在家里更好。虽然天气极其寒冷，但我在房间里非常温暖，每天都组织好炉子的柴火供应。靠近这些大森林，燃料根本不是问题。想到冰层不断逼近是很令人不安的，但目前港口依然开放，偶尔有船只进出。我有时能从这些船上获得一些美食，以补充在咖啡馆吃的餐食，这些餐食虽然充足，但缺乏变化。我安排在一个主房间旁边的凹室里用餐，这样我既远离了喧嚣和烟雾，也有了一定的隐私。

The work I was supposed to be doing among the ruins enabled me to keep the High House unobtrusively under observation. I never once caught sight of the girl, although on several occasions I saw the warden emerge, always accompanied by his bodyguard. He usually jumped straight into his big car and was driven off at tremendous speed. I gathered that threats from political opponents accounted for these precautions.  
我在废墟中从事的工作让我能够悄无声息地观察高屋。我从未见过那个女孩，尽管几次我看到了典狱长出现，总是有保镖陪伴。他通常直接跳进他的豪车，然后以极快的速度离开。我猜想这些防范措施是为了应对政治对手的威胁。

After two or three days I became impatient. I was getting nowhere and time was short. As she never seemed to leave the High House, I should have to get in. But no invitation arrived. I was trying to decide on the best excuse for approaching the warden again when he sent one of his guards to fetch me to lunch. The man intercepted me on my way to the café at midday. I disliked the absence of notice, and the whole imperious style of the summons and its delivery. It was more a command than an invitation, and, feeling obliged to protest, I said it was hardly possible to cancel the meal already prepared and waiting for me at that very moment. Instead of answering me, the guard shouted. Two more black tunics appeared from nowhere: the wearer of one was sent to explain things to the café proprietor, while the other stationed himself beside me. I now had no alternative but to go with this double escort. Of course I was glad to do so, it was what I wanted. But I would have preferred less high-handed treatment.  
两三天后，我开始感到焦躁不安。一切毫无进展，而时间紧迫。既然她似乎从不离开高屋，我就必须设法进入那里。然而，没有任何邀请到来。我正试图决定一个再次接近典狱长的最佳借口时，他却派了一名警卫来请我共进午餐。那人中午在我去咖啡馆的路上截住了我。我不喜欢这样毫无事先通知，充满霸道意味的召唤方式。这更像是一个命令，而不是邀请，出于礼貌，我提出了抗议，表示我实在无法取消已经准备好并正等待着我的饭菜。然而，那名警卫并没有回答我，而是大声喊叫。突然，两个穿着黑色制服的人从某个地方出现：其中一个被派去向咖啡馆老板解释情况，另一个则站在我身旁。我现在别无选择，只能在这双重护卫下前往。当然，我很高兴能去，这正是我想要的，但我更希望能少一些这样的高压待遇。

The warden led me straight into a large dining hall with a long table intended for twenty people. He took his chair at the head, an imposing figure. I was seated beside him. A third place was laid opposite. Seeing me glance at it, he said: “A young friend from your country is staying with me; I thought you might like to meet her.” He gave me one of his piercing looks as I replied calmly that I would be delighted. Inwardly I was exulting; it seemed almost too good to be true, the climax of my good fortune, to be spared the tricky business of asking to see her.  
典狱长直接带我进入一个宽敞的餐厅，餐厅内有一张可容纳二十人的长桌。他坐在首席位置，显得十分威严。我被安排坐在他旁边，对面则摆放了第三个座位。看到我瞥了一眼那个座位，他说道：“有一位你们国家的年轻朋友正住在我这里，我想你可能会愿意见见她。”我平静地回答说我非常乐意，他却用他那锐利的眼神瞥了我一眼。内心里，我欣喜若狂，这简直好得令人难以置信，是我好运的顶点，省去了我提出见她的麻烦。

Dry Martinis were brought in a frosted jug. Immediately afterward someone came in, whispered something, gave him a note. His face changed as he read the few words, he ripped the paper across and across, reducing it to minute fragments. “It appears the young person is indisposed.” I hid my disappointment by murmuring something polite. He was frowning furiously, obviously could not bear to be thwarted over the least thing; his anger pervaded the atmosphere. Saying no more to me, he signed for the extra setting to be removed, glasses and cutlery were whipped out of sight. The food was served, but he hardly touched what was on his plate, sat pounding the shreds of paper into a pulp with his clenched fist. I became more and more annoyed the longer he ignored me, particularly resenting this additional rudeness after the peremptory way he had sent for me. I wanted to get up and walk out, but knew it would be fatal to break off relations at this stage. To distract myself, I thought of the girl, decided I was probably responsible for her absence; she must have guessed who I was, if she had not known all along. I tried to imagine her alone in a silent room overhead. But she seemed miles away, a dream figure, inaccessible and unreal.  
干马提尼被盛在一个冰镇的酒壶中端上来。紧接着，有人进来，低声说了几句，递给他一张便条。他的脸色顿时变了，读完几行字后，他将纸条撕得粉碎。“那位年轻人身体不适。”我掩饰住失望，随口说了些客套话。他怒不可遏，显然无法容忍任何事情的挫折，愤怒的气氛弥漫整个房间。他没再对我说话，只是示意把多余的餐具撤掉，杯子和餐具被迅速收走。食物被端上来，但他几乎没动盘子里的东西，只是不断用拳头捶打着纸屑，把它们捣成一团。随着他继续无视我，我愈发恼怒，尤其是在他以如此专横的方式召见我之后，这种额外的无礼更让我难以忍受。我想站起来离开，但知道此时断绝关系会是致命的错误。为了分散注意力，我想到那位女孩，认为她的缺席可能是因为我；她一定猜到了我的身份，如果她不是一直都知道的话。我试图想象她独自在楼上的一间静室中。但她似乎远在天边，如梦似幻，难以接近。

The warden gradually became calmer, although his expression remained forbidding. I would not speak first, but waited for him to acknowledge my presence. A joint of excellent young lamb was carved, and while we were eating he referred abruptly to my investigations. “I notice you confine them to the ruins in my vicinity.” I was disconcerted, I had not known I was being watched. Luckily there was a ready-made answer. “As you know, these have always been the administrative buildings, so anything of interest is more likely to turn up here than anywhere else.” He said nothing, but made the sound of a player whose opponent claims a dubious point in the game. I could not tell whether my reply had satisfied him or not.  
总管逐渐恢复了冷静，尽管他的表情依然阴沉。我不先开口，而是等待他承认我的存在。上了一块上等的嫩羔羊腿，我们正在用餐时，他突然提到我的调查。“我注意到你把调查局限在我附近的废墟。”我感到不安，没想到自己一直在被监视。幸运的是，我有一个现成的答案。“如您所知，这些地方一直是行政建筑，所以有趣的东西更有可能在这里发现。”他没说什么，但发出了一种像棋局中对手声称得分时的模糊声音。我无法判断他是否满意我的回答。

Coffee was put on the table, and to my surprise, everybody withdrew from the room. I felt apprehensive, I could not imagine what he could have to say to me in private. His mood appeared to have hardened; he looked formidable, cold, distant. It was difficult to believe he had ever showed friendliness when he remarked ominously: “People who try to trick me usually regret it; I’m not easily taken in.” His voice was controlled and quiet, but the threat I had detected in it on a former occasion had become open. I said I did not understand what he meant; the obvious implication did not apply to me. He subjected me to a prolonged stare, which I returned with more coolness than I was feeling. An aura of danger and duplicity surrounded him, I was on my guard.  
咖啡端上桌时，令我惊讶的是，所有人都退出了房间。我感到不安，无法想象他在这种私密场合会对我说些什么。他的情绪似乎变得更加冷酷，表情严峻、冷漠、遥远。很难相信他曾经表现出友善的样子。他以阴沉的语气说道：“那些试图欺骗我的人通常都会后悔；我不是那么容易上当的。”他的声音控制得很平静，但在前几次交谈中我曾察觉到的威胁，这次已经变得明显。我说我不明白他的意思；他显而易见的暗示并不适用于我。他对我进行了长时间的注视，我也以远比内心感受的冷静神态回望他。一种危险和虚伪的气氛包围着他，我提高了警惕。

Pushing aside his cup, he leaned his elbows on the table, brought his face close to mine and went on gazing fixedly at me without a word. His eyes were startlingly bright, I could feel them trying to dominate me, and found it hard not to lower my own. He must have practiced hypnosis at some time: I had to keep up a sustained effort of resistance. It was a relief when he drew back a little, and said bluntly: “I want you to do something for me.” “What on earth can I possibly do for you?” I was astonished. “Listen. This is a small, poor, backward country, without resources. In an emergency we would be lost without the help of the big powers. Unfortunately the big powers consider us too insignificant to be of any interest. I want you to convince your government that we can be useful, if only because of our geographical position. I’m assuming you have the necessary influence?” I supposed I had; but I was taken back, I had not expected anything like this. My instinct was against it, and I began: “That sort of thing’s not my line at all—” He interrupted impatiently: “I’m simply asking you to point out to your politicians the advantage of co-operating with us. It should be easy. They’ve only got to look at the map.” Before I could think what to say, he pressed me again with increased impatience: “Well, will you do it?” His habit of dominance and his personal magnetism made it virtually impossible to refuse; almost involuntarily, I made a sound of assent. “Good. It’s a bargain. Of course you’ll receive an adequate return.” As if to clinch the matter, he stood up and held out his hand, adding: “You’d better write immediately to prepare the ground.” He picked up a small silver bell, rang it vigorously, people came trooping into the room. As he went to meet them, he dismissed me with a casual nod. I felt confused and uneasy, and was glad to get out of the place. I did not like this new turn of events, I had the impression my luck was changing.  

A day or two later his big car stopped beside me and he looked out, wearing a magnificent fur-lined overcoat. He wanted a word with me; would I come to the High House? I got in, we raced up to the entrance.  
几天后，他的大型汽车停在我身边，他穿着一件华丽的毛皮内衬大衣，探出头来。他想和我说几句话，我愿意去高府吗？我上了车，我们飞驰向高府的入口。

We went into a room full of people waiting to speak to him: the guards moved them back so that we could pass through to a room beyond. I heard him mutter, “Get rid of this fellow after five minutes,” before he dismissed his men. To me he said: “I presume you’ve written to someone about that bargain of ours?” I muttered something evasive. In quite a different tone he rapped out: “The post office informs me you have not communicated with any useful person. I took you for a man of your word; it seems I was mistaken.” To avoid a quarrel I took no notice of the insult, replied peaceably: “I haven’t heard yet what I’m to get out of the bargain.” Curtly he told me to state my terms. I decided to speak in a frank, simple manner, hoping to make him less hostile. “My request seems almost too trivial to mention after these preliminaries.” I gave him what I hoped was a disarming smile. “It’s simply this: I believe your guest may be an old acquaintance of mine, and should like to meet her in order to settle the point.” I was careful not to show too much interest.  
我们进入了一间挤满了等待与他交谈的人的房间，卫兵将他们推到一边，使我们可以穿过人群，进入另一间房间。我听见他低声咕哝道，“五分钟后把这个人打发走”，然后他解散了卫兵。他对我说：“我猜你已经给某人写信提到我们之间的交易了？”我含糊其辞地应付过去。他用完全不同的语气厉声道：“邮局通知我你没有与任何有用的人联系。我以为你是个守信的人，看来我错了。”为了避免争吵，我没有理会他的侮辱，平和地回答道：“我还没听说我能从这笔交易中得到什么好处呢。”他简短地要我说出我的条件。我决定坦诚、简单地说，希望能让他少些敌意。“在这些前提之下，我的要求似乎显得过于琐碎。”我给了他一个希望能解除戒备的微笑。“其实很简单：我相信你的客人可能是我的一位老相识，我想见见她，以确认这一点。”我小心翼翼地不表现出过多的兴趣。

He said nothing, but I could feel opposition behind his silence. Evidently there had been a change in his attitude since the day when he had proposed to introduce us at lunch. Now I felt pretty sure he would not agree to the meeting.  
他什么也没说，但我能感觉到他沉默背后的反对态度。显然，自从他那天提议在午餐时介绍我们以来，他的态度发生了变化。现在，我很确定他不会同意这次会面了。

Suddenly remembering the time, I looked at my watch. The five minutes had almost gone. I had no intention of waiting until the guards came in, according to orders, to throw me out, and began to make the opening moves of departure. He came to the door with me, kept his hand on the knob, preventing me from leaving. “She’s been unwell, and is nervous about meeting people. I shall have to ask if she’ll see you.” I was convinced he would not allow the meeting to take place, and looked at my watch again. There was only one minute left. “I really must go now. I’ve taken up too much of your time already.” His unexpected laughter took me by surprise; he must have known what was going on in my head. His mood seemed to alter suddenly, all at once his manner was easy. Once more I was momentarily aware of an obscure sense of inner contact with him. He opened the door and gave an order to the men standing outside, who saluted and marched away down the corridor, their boots thumping on the polished floor. He turned to me then, and as if demonstrating his goodwill, said: “We can go to her now, if you like. But I’ll have to prepare her first.”  
突然间，我意识到时间已晚，便看了看手表。五分钟几乎已经过去，我无意等待卫兵进来把我赶出去，因此开始做出离开的动作。他跟着我走到门口，一只手放在门把手上，阻止我离开。“她一直不太好，而且对见人感到紧张。我得先问问她是否愿意见你。”我确信他不会允许这次会面发生，再次看了看手表，时间只剩下一分钟。“我真的得走了。我已经占用了太多您的时间。”他意外地笑了起来，这让我感到惊讶；他一定知道我脑子里在想什么。他的情绪似乎突然改变了，态度也随之变得轻松了许多。刹那间，我再次隐约感觉到与他有一种模糊的内在联系。他打开门，对站在外面的卫兵下达了命令，他们行了个礼，踏着地板的响声沿走廊走远了。然后他转身对我说，仿佛在示好：“如果你愿意的话，我们现在可以去见她。不过，我得先让她做好准备。”

He took me back into the crowded waiting-room, where everybody surged round, eager to speak to him. He had a smile and a friendly word for those nearest, raised his voice to apologize generally for keeping them waiting, begged them all to be patient a few minutes longer, promised that everyone would be heard in due course. In a tone audible all over the room, he demanded: “Why is there no music?” then spoke sharply to a subordinate. “You know these people are my guests. The least we can do is try to entertain them if they have to wait.” The notes of a string quartet started to fill the room, and followed us out of it.  
他带我回到了拥挤的候客室，那里的人们争先恐后地围了过来，渴望与他说话。他对周围的人微笑，亲切地说了几句，然后提高声音，向大家致歉，表示歉意让他们等了这么久，并恳请他们再耐心等待片刻，承诺每个人都会按顺序被接见。他用全场都能听到的语气大声问道：“为什么没有音乐？”随后严厉地对一个下属说：“你知道这些人是我的客人。既然他们必须等待，最起码我们应该尽力娱乐他们。”这时，弦乐四重奏的音符开始充满整个房间，伴随着我们走了出去。

He led the way past more guards, strode quickly along winding corridors ahead of me, ran up and down several flights of stairs. It was all I could do to keep pace with him. He was in far better condition that I was, and seemed to enjoy demonstrating the fact, looking back at me, laughing, showing off his fine physique. I did not quite trust this sudden good humor. But I admired his tough athlete’s body, the wide shoulders and elegant, narrow waist. The passages seemed never-ending. I was breathless, he had to wait for me finally, standing at the top of yet another short staircase. The landing was in deep shadow, I could just distinguish the rectangle of a single door, and realized that the stairs led only to this one room.  
他带路经过更多的守卫，快步穿过蜿蜒的走廊，时而跑上跑下几段楼梯。我尽力跟上他的步伐。他的体力显然比我好得多，似乎很享受这种展示，不时回头看着我，笑着炫耀他那健美的体格。我对他这种突然的好心情有些不信任，但又不得不佩服他那结实的运动员身材，宽阔的肩膀和优雅的窄腰。走廊仿佛没有尽头，我气喘吁吁，他不得不等着我，最终站在又一段短楼梯的顶部。这个平台笼罩在阴影中，我只能勉强辨认出一个单独的门框，意识到这段楼梯只通向这一个房间。

He told me to stay where I was for a minute while he explained the situation to the girl, adding, with a malicious grin: “It’ll give you time to cool off a bit.” With his hand on the door knob, he went on: “You understand, don’t you, that it’s entirely up to her to decide. There’s nothing I can do if she prefers not to see you.” He opened the door without knocking and vanished into the room.  
当他准备开门时，他指示我在原地待一会儿。 “我会向她解释一下情况。”他补充道，笑容中带着一丝恶意。 “这会让你有时间冷静一下。”他把手放在门把手上，继续道：“你明白吧，这完全由她决定。如果她不愿意见你，我也无能为力。”说完，他没有敲门就打开门，消失在房间里，留下我在灯光昏暗的楼梯平台上，我的心里充满了希望和忧虑。

Left out there in the semi-darkness, I felt gloomy and irritated. He seemed to have got the better of me by a trick. Nothing satisfactory to myself could come of an interview arranged and introduced by him. Most probably it would not materialize at all; either she would refuse to see me, or he would forbid her to do so. In any case, I did not want to talk to her in his presence, when she would be under his influence.  
被留在半明半暗的走廊上，我感到既沮丧又恼火。他似乎通过某种诡计占了上风。由他安排和引导的会面，不会带来任何对我有利的结果。很可能，这次会面根本不会实现；她可能会拒绝见我，或者他会禁止她这样做。无论如何，我都不想在他的存在下与她交谈，因为那样她必然会受到他的影响。

I listened, but could hear nothing through the soundproofed wall. After some moments I went down the stairs and wandered round dark passages until I met a servant who showed me the way out. My lucky period certainly seemed to be over.  
我屏息聆听，但通过隔音墙根本听不到任何声音。过了一会儿，我走下楼梯，漫无目的地在黑暗的走廊中游荡，直到遇到一名仆人，他为我指引了出去的方向。这段运气好的时期显然已经走到了尽头。
