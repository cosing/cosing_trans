## TEN

It could have been any town, in any country. I recognized nothing. Snow covered all landmarks with the same white padding. Buildings were changed into anonymous white cliffs.  
这可能是任何一个城镇，位于任何一个国家。我什么也认不出来。白雪覆盖了所有地标，铺上一层相同的白色垫层。建筑物变成了无名的白色悬崖。

A confused disturbance, shouts, the noise of wood splintering and glass breaking came from one of the streets where looting was going on. A crowd had broken into the shops. They had no leader, no fixed objective. They were just a disorderly mob surging about in search of excitement and booty, frightened, hungry, hysterical, violent. They kept fighting among themselves, picking up anything that could be used as a weapon, snatching each other’s spoils, taking possession of all they could lay hands on, even the most useless objects, then dropping them and running after some other plunder. What they could not take away they destroyed. They had a senseless mania for destruction, for tearing to shreds, smashing to smithereens, trampling underfoot.  
一阵混乱的骚动、喊叫声、木头破裂和玻璃破碎的声音从一条正在发生抢劫的街道上传来。一群人闯入了商店。他们没有领袖，也没有明确的目标，只是一个无序的暴民，为了寻求刺激和战利品而四处奔波，惊恐、饥饿、歇斯底里、暴力。他们不停地互相争斗，捡起任何可以用作武器的东西，抢夺彼此的战利品，占有他们能拿到的一切，甚至是最无用的物品，然后又扔掉它们，追逐其他的掠夺物。他们无法带走的东西就毁掉，疯狂地进行破坏，撕裂成碎片，砸得粉碎，踩在脚下。

A senior army officer appeared in the street and blew a whistle to summon the police. Striding toward the looters, he shouted orders in a fierce military voice, blew repeated blasts on the whistle. His face was dark with rage, framed by the astrakhan collar of his fine overcoat. The main mass of the crowd fled at the sight of him. But some, bolder than the rest, stayed skulking among the wreckage. Furious, he strode toward them, threatened them with his cane, shouted to them to clear off, swore at them. They took no notice at first; then formed a rough circle, rushed at him from several points simultaneously, in groups of three or four together. He pulled out his revolver, fired it over their heads. A mistake: he should have fired at them. They swarmed round him, trying to snatch the weapon. The police were a long time coming. There was a scuffle. In the course of it, either by accident or intention, the gun was dropped through a grating. Its owner was a man in his late fifties, tall, vigorous. But I could see him panting. They were young toughs with faces of a sinister blankness. They attacked cunningly, with bits of metal and broken glass, pieces of smashed furniture, whatever came to hand. He fended them off with his cane, keeping his back to a wall. Their numbers and their persistence were gradually wearing him down; his movements were getting slower. A stone was thrown. Then a shower of stones. One of them knocked his cap off. The sight of his hairless skull produced ribald shouting, and for a second he seemed disconcerted. They took advantage of this, closed in, set on him like a pack of wolves. Blood trickling down his face, back to the wall, he still managed to fight them off. Then I saw something flash: someone had used a knife. Others followed suit. He clutched his chest, blindly staggered forward. The moment he left the wall he was done for, they were on him from every side. They knocked him down, sprang on top of him, tore his coat off, beat his head on the frozen ground, stamped on him, kicked him, slashed his face with chains. Finally he lay still on the snow. He had had absolutely no chance. It was murder.  
一名高级军官出现在街上，吹响了哨子召唤警察。他大步走向那些抢劫者，用威严的军人声音大声发布命令，不断吹响哨子。他的脸因愤怒而变得阴沉，与他精美大衣上的阿斯特拉罕领子形成对比。大部分人群在看到他时都逃走了。但有些比其他人更大胆的人躲在废墟中。他愤怒地走向他们，用手杖威胁他们，喊叫着让他们离开，咒骂他们。他们起初并不理会，后来形成一个粗略的圆圈，从几个点同时冲向他，三四个人一组。他拔出手枪，朝他们头上开了一枪。这是个错误：他应该对他们开枪。他们蜂拥而上，试图夺走武器。警察迟迟没有到来。发生了混战。在混战中，不知是意外还是故意，枪掉进了格栅下方。枪的主人是一个五十多岁、身材高大、精力充沛的男人。但我看到他在喘息。那些年轻的恶棍，面孔阴沉。他们狡猾地攻击，用金属碎片和破碎的玻璃、碎裂的家具，手边的任何东西。他用手杖抵挡他们，把背靠在墙上。他们的人数和坚持逐渐让他体力不支；他的动作越来越慢。一块石头被扔了过来。然后是一阵石头雨。一个石块击落了他的帽子，光秃的头顶引发了粗俗的喊叫，他显得有些不知所措。他们利用这个机会，围上来，像一群狼一样扑向他。血从他的脸上滴落，他背靠墙，仍然设法把他们击退。然后我看到有什么东西闪了一下：有人用了一把刀。其他人也跟着动手。他捂着胸口，盲目地向前踉跄。当他离开墙的那一刻，他就完了，他们从四面八方扑向他，把他击倒，扑在他身上，撕掉他的外套，把他的头砸在冰冷的地面上，踩踏他，踢他，用链子划伤他的脸。最后他静静地躺在雪地上。他根本没有任何机会。这是谋杀。

It was not my affair, but I could not see it and stand there doing nothing. They were society’s dregs, they would never have dared come near him in normal times, far less touch him. A little jeering fellow had draped himself in the fine overcoat and was dancing about, tripping over the trailing hem. I was disgusted, furious. In uncontrollable fury I charged at him, stripped off the coat, twisted his arms, punched and pummel him, slung him across the pavement, heard a satisfactory crunch when his screaming face hit the wall. Turning, I confronted a man twice his size, half saw a boot flick out. Acute pain in my leg made me stumble: I recovered just in time to see his arm swing up in a practiced curve, and reacted as I had been trained. A textbook fall; flat on my back, one foot locking his ankle, I caught the glint of the falling knife, as my other leg bashed the trapped kneecap until it cracked. In a moment I would have the entire crew swarming all over me. I had no more chance than the officer against the lot of them with their knives; but I meant to do some damage before they finished me off. Suddenly there were shots, shouts, the sound of running feet: the police had arrived at last. I watched them chase the looters round a corner into another street; then limped over to the man on the ground.  
这与我无关，但我不能眼睁睁地看着不做任何事。他们是社会的渣滓，平时根本不敢靠近他，更不用说触碰他。一个小个子披着那件精致的外套，满地乱跳，脚被拖地的衣摆绊倒了。我感到恶心，愤怒到了极点。愤怒之下，我冲向他，剥下外套，扭住他的手臂，用拳头猛击他，把他甩到人行道上。当他的脸撞到墙上发出令人满意的咔嚓声时，我听到了他的尖叫。转身时，我面对一个是他两倍大的人，模糊地看到一只靴子飞了出来。剧烈的腿痛让我踉跄了一下，我刚好恢复过来，就看到他手臂以一种娴熟的弧线挥动，我按照训练做出了反应。教科书般的摔倒：平躺在地上，一只脚锁住他的脚踝，我看到刀子在下落时闪过的寒光，用另一只腿猛击他被困的膝盖，直到它碎裂。很快，整个暴徒团伙就会蜂拥而上。面对这些持刀的人，我和那个军官一样毫无胜算；但在他们把我解决之前，我打算造成一些伤害。突然，传来枪声、喊叫声和跑步声：警察终于来了。我看着他们追着抢劫者转过街角，然后一瘸一拐地走向倒在地上的那个人。

He lay on his back, bleeding from many wounds. Not much past the prime of life, he had looked impressive, a tall, vital, imposing man, still desirable physically. Now his nose had been flattened, his mouth slit at the corners, one eye was half out of its socket, his whole face and head discolored with blood and dirt, the shapes lost and distorted. Blood was everywhere. They had almost torn off his right arm. He did not move, I could not see his breathing. I knelt down, opened his tunic, his shirt, put my hand on his chest. The heart was not to be felt, and my hand came out sticky with blood. I wiped it on my handkerchief, then went for his coat, spread it over him, hiding the mess. I wanted to leave him some dignity. He was a stranger to whom I had never spoken; but he was my sort of man; we were not like that rabble. It was an outrage that they should have killed him. They must have cringed before him in his strength and power. This was how they treated him when they caught him alone, no longer young, and at a disadvantage. It was disgusting. I regretted not having inflicted more punishment on them.  
他仰面躺着，身上多处受伤流血。虽然已过盛年，但他曾经看起来很有气势，是个高大、充满活力、令人印象深刻的男人，依然具有吸引力。现在他的鼻子被打平了，嘴角裂开，一个眼睛半脱出眼眶，整个脸和头部因血迹和污垢变得颜色斑驳，面目全非，形状失真。到处都是血。他的右臂几乎被撕裂。他一动不动，我看不到他的呼吸。我跪下来，打开他的上衣和衬衫，把手放在他的胸口。心跳感受不到，手上沾满了黏黏的血。我把手在手帕上擦干净，然后拿起他的外套，盖在他身上，遮住那一片狼藉。我想为他保留一些尊严。他是一个我从未交谈过的陌生人；但他是我这样的人；我们不是那种乌合之众。他们竟然把他杀了，简直是无耻之极。他们一定曾经在他强大和威严面前胆怯不已。而当他们抓住了孤立无援的他，年老体弱，处于劣势时，就这样对待他。这真是恶心。我后悔没有对他们施加更多的惩罚。

I remembered the revolver, stooped over the grating. There was just room for my fingers between the bars, and I pulled it up, put it into my pocket, moved on. I was still limping badly, my leg was painful. Suddenly someone shouted, a shot zipped past. I stopped, waited until the police overtook me. “Who are you? What are you doing here? Why did you touch the body? It’s not allowed.” Before I could answer, there was a rasping noise and a ground-floor window burst open, dislodging masses of snow from the sill, a woman’s head stuck out just beside me. “This man’s brave. He deserves a medal. I saw what happened. He rushed in and tackled the lot of them single-handed, although they had knives and he was unarmed. I saw everything from this window.” A policeman wrote down her name and address in his notebook.  
我想起了手枪，俯身在格栅上。手指勉强可以伸进栏杆之间，我把它捞了上来，放进口袋，继续前行。我还在严重地跛行，腿痛得厉害。突然有人喊叫，一声枪响在耳边掠过。我停下，等着警察赶上我。“你是谁？在这里干什么？为什么碰那具尸体？这是不允许的。”我还没来得及回答，就听到一阵刺耳的声音，底楼的一扇窗户猛然打开，窗台上的积雪纷纷落下，一个女人的头探出来，就在我身边。“这个人很勇敢，他应该得到奖章。我看见了事情的经过。他冲进去，单枪匹马地对付了他们，虽然他们有刀，而他手无寸铁。我从这扇窗户看到了一切。”一个警察在笔记本上记下了她的姓名和地址。

Their attitude became more friendly; but they insisted that I should go to the station and make a report. One of them took my arm. “It’s only in the next street. You look as if you could do with some first aid.” I had to go in. It was unfortunate: I did not want to give an account of myself and my movements and motives. Besides, the revolver would make things awkward if it was noticed; they were bound to recognize the service pattern. When I took off my coat, I arranged it carefully so that the bulge did not show. They patched me up, strapped my leg with plaster. I had a wash, drank some strong coffee with rum in it. The chief interviewed me alone. He glanced at my papers, but gave the impression of being preoccupied with something else: it was not possible to ask if he had any precise information about the advancing ice. We exchanged cigarettes, discussed the food problem. He said rations were short, and distributed according to the value to the community of each individual’s work: “No work, no food.” His face showed signs of strain while he was talking; the crisis must be nearer than I had supposed. Planning my questions deliberately, I asked about refugees. Gangs of starving fugitives from the ice were a problem in all the surviving countries. “If they’re able to work we let them stay. We need all the workers we can get.” I said: “Doesn’t that create difficulties? How do you manage to house them all?” “There are camps for the men. We put the women in hostels.” I had been leading up to this point. Pretending to take a professional interest, I inquired: “Would I be allowed to look over one of these places?” “Why not?” His smile was tired. I could not tell whether he was exceptionally civilized or merely indifferent. Before I left he gave me an address. Things had turned out very much better than I had expected. I had got the information I wanted, and a good army revolver.  
他们的态度变得友好起来，但他们坚持要我去警察局做笔录。其中一个警察挽住我的手臂说：“就在下一个街区。你看起来需要一些急救。”我只好跟他们去了。这很不幸：我不想解释自己的身份、行踪和动机。而且，如果他们注意到手枪，事情会变得很尴尬；他们肯定会认出这是军用款式。当我脱下外套时，我小心地把它摆好，以免露出鼓起的部分。他们帮我包扎了伤口，用石膏固定了我的腿。我洗了洗脸，喝了一些加了朗姆酒的浓咖啡。局长单独和我进行了谈话。他瞥了眼我的证件，但看上去心不在焉，似乎被别的事情困扰着：我没法问他是否有关于冰川推进的确切消息。我们互相递了烟，讨论起粮食问题。他说口粮紧张，根据每个人对社会的贡献来分配：“不工作，就没饭吃。”他谈话时，脸上显露出紧张的神色；危机可能比我想象的还要紧迫。我故意安排好问题，询问起难民的情况。饥饿的冰川逃亡者在所有幸存的国家都成了问题。“如果他们能工作，我们就让他们留下。我们需要所有能找到的工人。”我问：“这不会造成困难吗？你们怎么安置他们？”“男人住在营地。我们把女人安置在宿舍。”我一直在引导话题到这个点。假装出一种职业兴趣，我问道：“我能去看看这些地方吗？”“为什么不呢？”他的笑容显得疲惫。我无法判断他是特别文明还是仅仅无动于衷。在我离开之前，他给了我一个地址。事情比我预想的要好得多。我得到了我想要的信息，还有一把不错的军用手枪。

I went to look for her. It was snowing again, the wind was colder and stronger. The streets were deserted, there was nobody to direct me. I thought I had found the house, but saw no sign. Perhaps I was too late: through an unaccountable failure of impulse had waited too long . . . I tried the street doors as I passed them; they were all locked.  
我去寻找她。雪又开始下了，风变得更加寒冷和猛烈。街道上空无一人，没有人可以指引我。我以为找到了那座房子，但没有看到任何标志。也许我来得太晚了：由于无法解释的犹豫不决，我等得太久……我经过时尝试推开街道上的门；它们全都锁着。

The door of one house was unfastened. I entered without hesitation. Inside, the place was bare and shabby, had the look of an institution. The rooms were unheated. She sat wearing her gray overcoat, her legs wrapped in something that looked like a curtain. As soon as she saw me she threw this aside and sprang up. “You! I suppose he sent you—didn’t you get my message?” “No one sent me. What message?” “I left a message telling you not to follow me.” I said I had not received it, but if I had it would have made no difference, I should have come just the same. Her big distrustful eyes gazed at me, indignant and frightened. “I don’t want anything to do with either of you.” I ignored this. “You can’t stay here alone.” “Why not? I’m getting on all right.” I asked what she was doing. “Working.” “How much do they pay you?” “We get our food.” “No money?” “Sometimes people are given money when they’ve worked specially hard.” Defensively she went on: “I’m too thin for the really hard jobs. They say I haven’t got enough stamina.” I had been watching her: she looked half-starved, as if for some time she had not had enough to eat. Her thin wrists had always fascinated me; now I could scarcely take my eyes off them, emerging like sticks from the heavy sleeves. Instead of inquiring into the nature of the work she was doing, I asked her plans for the future. When she snapped: “Why should I tell you?” I knew that she had no plans. I said I very much wished she would look on me as a friend. “Why? I’ve no reason to. Anyhow, I don’t need friends. I can manage alone.” I told her I had come hoping to take her away with me to a place where life would be easier, somewhere in a better climate. I felt her beginning to weaken, waved my hand at the window covered in heavy frost, snow banked on the sill to half its whole height. “Haven’t you had enough of the cold?” She could no longer hide her nervousness, her hands twisted together. I added: “Besides, you’re in the danger zone here.” Her face was starting to have its bruised look, she was gradually losing control. “What danger?” The pupils of her eyes dilated as I watched her. “The ice . . .” I meant to say more, but the two words were sufficient. Her whole appearance indicated fear, she began to tremble.  
有一座房子的门没有锁。我毫不犹豫地走了进去。屋内空荡破旧，显得像是一个收容所。房间里没有供暖。她穿着灰色外套坐在那里，双腿裹着看起来像是窗帘的东西。一看到我，她就把它扔到一旁，猛地站了起来。“是你！我猜你是他派来的——你没收到我的消息吗？”“没有人派我来。什么消息？”“我留了一条消息告诉你不要跟踪我。”我说我没收到，但即使收到了也没什么区别，我还是会来的。她那双充满戒备的大眼睛怒视着我，充满了愤怒和恐惧。“我不想跟你们任何一个人有关系。”我忽略了这句话，“你不能一个人留在这里。”“为什么不能？我过得很好。”我问她在做什么。“工作。”“他们给你多少钱？”“我们得到食物。”“没有钱吗？”“有时人们干得特别努力时会得到一些钱。”她带着防御性的口吻继续说道：“我太瘦了，干不了真正的重活。他们说我体力不够。”我一直在观察她：她看起来营养不良，似乎有一段时间没有好好吃饭了。她那纤细的手腕总是让我着迷；现在我几乎无法将目光移开，它们像树枝一样从厚重的袖子中伸出来。我没有询问她的工作内容，而是问她对未来的打算。她生气地反问：“我为什么要告诉你？”我知道她没有计划。我说我非常希望她能把我当作朋友。“为什么？我没有理由这么做。再说了，我不需要朋友。我一个人也能应付。”我告诉她，我来是希望带她去一个生活会更轻松的地方，那里气候更好。我向窗外冻得结实的窗户挥了挥手，雪堆积在窗台上，几乎有一半的高度。“你难道还没受够这寒冷吗？”她已经无法掩饰她的紧张，双手扭在一起。我补充道：“而且，你留在这里很危险。”她的脸开始显出一种受伤的神情，她逐渐失去了控制。“什么危险？”她的瞳孔在我注视下放大了。“冰雪……”，我本来想多说些，但这两个字已经足够了。她整个面容显示出恐惧，开始颤抖起来。

I moved closer to her, touched her hand. She jerked it away. “Don’t do that!” I held a fold of her coat, looked at her angry, frightened face of a child betrayed, the look of faint bruising round the eyes like a child that has cried a long time. “Leave me alone!” She tried to drag the heavy material out of my hand. “Go away!” I did not move. “Then I’ll go!” She tore herself free, dashed to the door, threw her whole weight against it. It crashed open so violently that she lost her balance and fell. The bright hair spread on the floor, quicksilver, brilliant, stirring, alive, on the dark, dull, dead, dirty floor. I picked her up. She struggled, gasped: “Let me go! I hate you, I hate you!” She had no strength at all. It was like holding a struggling kitten. I shut the door and turned the key in the lock.  
我走近她，轻轻触碰她的手。她猛地把手抽了回去。“别碰我！”我抓住她外套的一角，看着她那愤怒、恐惧的脸庞，如同一个被背叛的孩子，眼圈带着淡淡的淤青，像是哭了很久。“离我远点！”她试图从我手中挣脱那厚重的布料。“走开！”我没有动。“那我走！”她奋力挣脱，冲向门口，整个身子猛地撞上门。门猛烈地打开，她失去了平衡，摔倒在地。那亮丽的头发像水银般散开，在黑暗、暗淡、死气沉沉的脏地板上闪耀、翻动、仿佛有了生命。我把她扶起来。她挣扎着，气喘吁吁地说：“放开我！我恨你，我恨你！”她几乎没有力气，就像抱着一只挣扎的小猫。我关上门，转动钥匙，把门锁上。

I waited a few days, although waiting was difficult. It was time to go. It was only a matter of hours before a disaster of the magnitude. In spite of the secrecy which enveloped the subject, news must have leaked out. Agitated activity suddenly spread through the town. From my window I watched a young man running from house to house, delivering a message of terror. In an astonishingly short time, minutes only, the street was full of people carrying bags and bundles. Disorganized, and showing every sign of acute fear, they set off in great haste, some going one way and some another. They seemed to have no definite destination or plan, just the one overwhelming urge to fly from the town. I was surprised that the authorities took no action. Presumably they had failed to evolve a workable scheme for evacuation, so simply decided to let things take their course. The chaotic exodus was disturbing to watch. Everybody seemed on the verge of panic. People clearly thought I was mad to sit in a bar instead of preparing for flight. Their fears were infectious; the atmosphere of impending catastrophe made me uneasy, and I was thankful to get the message I was expecting. A ship was about to anchor outside the harbor, somewhere beyond the ice. It was the last one that would call, and it would stay at anchor for one hour only.  
我等了几天，尽管等待很难熬。是时候离开了。灾难即将来临，只是几个小时的问题。尽管消息被严密封锁，但肯定已经泄露了出去。城里突然充满了紧张的活动。我从窗户看到一个年轻人挨家挨户地跑，传递着恐惧的讯息。令人惊讶的是，短短几分钟内，街道上就挤满了提着包裹的人们。他们慌乱不堪，表现出极度的恐惧，急匆匆地出发，有的往这边走，有的往那边走。他们似乎没有明确的目的地或计划，只是有一种压倒一切的逃离这座城市的冲动。我很惊讶当局没有采取任何行动。可能是因为他们没有制定出可行的疏散方案，所以干脆让事情自然发展。这场混乱的逃亡令人不安。每个人似乎都处于恐慌的边缘。人们显然觉得我坐在酒吧里而不是准备逃跑简直是疯了。他们的恐惧具有传染性，迫在眉睫的灾难气氛让我感到不安，我感激终于收到了期待已久的消息。一艘船即将停泊在港外，冰层之外的某个地方。这是最后一艘船，它只会停泊一个小时。

I went to the girl, told her this was our last chance, and that she had to come. She refused, refused to stand up. “I’m not going anywhere with you. I don’t trust you. I shall stay here where I’m free.” “Free for what? To starve? To be frozen to death?” I lifted her off the chair bodily, stood her on her feet. “I won’t go—you can’t force me.” She backed away, wide eyed, and stood against the wall, waiting for someone or something to rescue her. I lost patience, dragged her out of the building, went on holding her arm; I had to pull her along.  
我找到那个女孩，告诉她这是我们最后的机会，她必须跟我走。她拒绝了，拒绝站起来。“我不跟你走。我不信任你。我会留在这里，在这里我自由。” “自由干什么？饿死？冻死？” 我把她从椅子上抱起来，让她站好。“我不走——你不能强迫我。”她惊恐地睁大眼睛，退到墙边，等待某人或某物来救她。我失去了耐心，把她从建筑里拖出来，一直抓着她的手臂；我不得不拉着她走。

It was snowing so hard I could barely see to the other side of the street; a stark, white, deathly, pre-polar scene. The arctic wind drove floods of snow past us like feathers. Walking was difficult, the wind slammed the snow in our faces, hurled it at us from different sides, whirled it round us in crazy spirals. Everything was muffled, blurred, indistinct, not a person to be seen. Then suddenly six mounted policemen rode out of the blizzard, hooves soundless and bridles jingling. The girl cried, “Help!” when she saw them. She thought they would save her, tried to struggle free, made an imploring gesture with her free hand. I held on to her tight, kept her close beside me. The men laughed and whistled at us as they passed, disappearing in the blowing white. She burst into tears.  
雪下得那么大，我几乎看不见街对面；整个景象苍白、死寂，宛如极地前奏。北极风裹挟着阵阵雪浪，像羽毛般从我们身边掠过。行走变得艰难，风夹带着雪花猛击我们的脸，从不同方向扑来，在我们周围卷起疯狂的旋涡。一切都被包裹着，模糊不清，看不见一个人。突然间，六名骑警从暴风雪中骑马而出，马蹄无声，缰绳叮当作响。女孩看到他们时喊道，“救命！”她以为他们会救她，试图挣脱，在挣扎中用另一只手做出恳求的姿势。我紧紧地抓住她，把她拉在身边。那些骑警在经过我们时大笑着，吹着口哨，很快消失在了风雪弥漫的白茫茫中。她哭了起来。

I heard a bell ringing, slowly coming nearer. An old priest shuffled round the corner, black-cowled, bent double against the storm, leading a rabble of people. The bell was the sort used to call schoolchildren from the playground; as he walked, he kept ringing it feebly. When his arm tired, he gave it a brief rest, calling out in a quavering voice: “Sauve qui peut!” Some of his followers took up the cry, chanting it like a dirge: one or two paused long enough to bang on the doors they were passing. From some of the houses muffled figures crept out to join them. I wondered where they were going; it did not look as if they would get very far. They were all old and infirm, decrepit. The young and able-bodied had left them behind. They moved with weak tottering steps in a slow, shambling procession, their movements uncoordinated, their faded faces reddened by the blast.  
我听到一个铃声，缓慢地靠近。一个年迈的神父从拐角处踱步而来，披着黑色斗篷，身子弯曲，顶着风雪，带领着一群杂乱的人群。那铃声是那种用来召唤放学儿童的；他一边走一边有气无力地摇动着铃铛。当他的手臂疲惫时，他稍微停顿片刻，用颤抖的声音喊道：“各自逃命！”他的一些追随者接过了他的呼声，像是在唱哀歌一般地重复着；有一两个人停下来，敲打着他们经过的房门。一些房子里裹得严严实实的人影缓缓爬出来，加入了他们的队伍。我不禁想，他们要去哪里？看起来他们走不了多远。他们都是年老体弱，步履蹒跚。年轻健壮的人已经把他们抛在了后面。他们以虚弱、摇晃的步伐缓慢前行，像是一支杂乱的队伍，他们的动作不协调，褪色的脸庞在狂风中被吹得发红。

The girl kept stumbling in the deep snow. I had to half carry her, although I could hardly breathe. The frost tore my breath away, tried to stop me breathing; my breath froze in icicles on my collar. The frozen mucous membranes plugged my nose with ice. Each time I took a mouthful of polar air I coughed and gasped. It seemed hours before we got to the harbor. She renewed her feeble struggles at the sight of the boat, cried: “You can’t do this to me . . .” I pushed her in, jumped in after her, seized the oars, shoved off, started rowing with all my might.  
女孩在深雪中不断跌倒。我不得不半抱着她，尽管我几乎无法呼吸。霜冻剥夺了我的呼吸，试图让我窒息；我的呼吸在衣领上冻结成了冰柱。冻硬的粘膜把我的鼻孔塞满了冰。每次吸入一口极地空气，我都咳嗽和喘气。似乎过了好几个小时，我们才到达港口。看到船后，她再次虚弱地挣扎，哭喊着：“你不能这样对我……”我把她推上船，自己紧跟着跳上去，抓起船桨，用力划开，开始拼命地划桨。

Voices screamed after us, but I ignored them; she was my one concern. The open channel had narrowed considerably, its edges frozen; soon it would be solid ice. Extraordinary loud, long cracks, like shots, like thunderclaps, came from the thickening ice of the harbor. My face felt raw, my hands were blue and burning with cold, but I kept on rowing toward the ship, through the churning white of the blizzard, through flying spray, booming ice, shrieks, crashes, blood. A small boat foundered beside us, the water seethed with frantically lashing limbs. Desperate drowning fingers clawed at the gunwale; I beat them off. A pair of lovers floated past, locked together by frozen arms, rocking and rolling deliriously in the waves. Suddenly the boat gave a violent lurch; I swung round, pulling out my revolver. I knew what had happened. Behind my back a man had climbed over the side. I fired, thrust him into the water again, watched it turn red. The ship’s side loomed steep as a cliff above us, the companion-ladder only reached to my shoulder. Somehow or other, by a colossal effort, I managed to hoist the girl on to the wooden steps, climbed up after her, pushed her up to the deck. We were allowed to stay. No one else came aboard. The ship started moving immediately. It was a triumph.  
有人在我们身后尖叫，但我没有理会他们；她是我唯一的关注焦点。开放的航道已经大大缩小，边缘开始结冰；很快就会变成固体冰块。港口加厚的冰层发出极为响亮、持久的裂痕声，像枪声，像雷鸣。我的脸感到生疼，双手冻得发蓝，仿佛在燃烧，但我继续向船划去，穿过狂风暴雪中的翻腾白浪，穿过飞溅的水花，穿过咆哮的冰层、尖叫声、撞击声、鲜血。一艘小船在我们旁边翻覆，水面上充满了狂乱扑打的四肢。绝望的溺水者用指尖抓住船舷；我用力把他们打掉。一对恋人被冻住的双臂紧紧相扣，浮在水面上，随波逐流，疯狂地摇晃。突然，船剧烈晃动；我迅速转身，拔出手枪。我知道发生了什么。一个男人爬上了船的侧面。我开枪，将他推回水中，看着水变成红色。船的侧面像悬崖一样陡峭出现在我们面前，舷梯只到我的肩膀。我不知怎么，凭借巨大的努力，设法把女孩托上木梯，然后跟着爬了上去，把她推上甲板。我们被允许留下。没有其他人上船。船立即开始移动。这是一次胜利。

We traveled on, changing from ship to ship. She could not stand the intense cold, she shivered continually, broke in pieces like a Venetian glass. The disintegration could be observed. She grew thinner and paler, more transparent, ghostlike. It was interesting to watch. She did not move more than was absolutely essential. Her limbs seemed too brittle for use. The seasons ceased to exist, replaced by perpetual cold. Ice walls loomed and thundered, smooth, shining, unearthly, a glacial nightmare; the light of day lost in eerie, iceberg-glittering mirage-light. With one arm I warmed and supported her: the other arm was the executioner’s.  
我们继续前行，不断换船。她无法忍受刺骨的寒冷，不停地发抖，像威尼斯玻璃一样碎裂。她的瓦解是可以观察到的。她变得越来越瘦，越来越苍白，越来越透明，像幽灵一样。这景象很有意思。她除非绝对必要，否则不会移动。她的四肢似乎脆弱得无法使用。季节不再存在，取而代之的是永恒的寒冷。冰墙耸立，雷鸣般轰响，光滑、闪亮，超凡脱俗，像是冰川噩梦；白昼的光线在怪异的冰山幻影光中消失。我用一只手臂温暖并支撑着她：另一只手臂是刽子手的。

The cold abated slightly. We went ashore to wait for a different ship. The country had been at war, the town had suffered severe damage. There was no accommodation available; only one hotel was being rebuilt, only one floor was finished, every habitable room occupied. I could not persuade or bribe anybody to take us in. Travelers were disliked and discouraged: it was natural, in the circumstances. We were told we could stay at some sort of center for strangers outside the town, drove there through the ruined suburbs, everything flattened, no trace of trees or gardens remaining, nothing left standing upright. The country beyond had been a battlefield and was now a desert, covered in shapeless rubbish.  
寒冷稍有缓解。我们上岸等待另一艘船。这个国家曾经经历过战争，城镇遭受了严重破坏。没有可以住宿的地方；只有一家旅馆正在重建，仅有一层完工，每一个可居住的房间都已被占用。我既无法说服，也无法贿赂任何人接纳我们。在那种情况下，旅行者不受欢迎，自然也是被劝退的。我们被告知可以在城外的一种为陌生人设立的中心暂住，于是我们穿过被毁的郊区驱车前往，一切都被夷为平地，树木和花园都已无影无踪，没有任何东西还保持着直立。郊区之外曾是战场，现在成了荒漠，覆盖着无形的废墟。

We were deposited at a place which had been a farm. All around was indescribable chaos. Bits of broken carts, tractors, cars, implements, lay about, bits of old tires, bits of unrecognizable tools, all mixed up with the debris of shattered weapons and war supplies. Our escort walked cautiously, told us to look out for mines, unexploded bombs. Inside, the rooms were littered with fragments of all kind of rubbish, too smashed to identify. They took us to a room with an earth floor and no furniture, holes in the walls, roof roughly boarded over, where three people sat on the ground, propped against the wall. They were silent, unmoving, hardly seemed alive, took no notice when I spoke to them. I learned later that they were deaf, their eardrums had burst. There were many in the same state all over the country, their faces ripped and lips torn by the same deadly wind. A desperately sick man lay on the floor under a thin blanket. Great tufts of his hair had fallen out, strips of skin hung from his hands and face, his loose teeth rattled in black bleeding gums every time he coughed, he never stopped coughing and groaning and spitting blood. Emaciated cats wandered in and out, licked the blood with delicate pointed pink tongues.  
我们被送到一个曾经是农场的地方。四周一片难以形容的混乱。破碎的马车、拖拉机、汽车、工具散落四处，旧轮胎的碎片、不明工具的残片，混杂在破碎的武器和战争物资的残骸中。我们的护送人员小心翼翼地走着，告诉我们要注意地雷和未爆炸的炸弹。室内的房间里满是各种无法辨认的垃圾碎片。他们带我们来到一个地面是泥土、没有家具的房间，墙上有洞，屋顶被粗略地用木板盖着。三个人靠在墙上坐在地上，他们沉默不语，几乎没有生命迹象，对我的问话也毫无反应。后来我才知道，他们是聋子，耳膜已经破裂。全国各地有很多人处于同样的状态，他们的脸被撕裂，嘴唇被同样致命的风撕裂。一名病得非常严重的男子躺在地上，盖着一条薄薄的毯子。他的头发成簇地脱落，手和脸上挂着条条皮肉，他松动的牙齿每次咳嗽时都在黑色的流血牙龈中咔咔作响，他不停地咳嗽、呻吟和吐血。骨瘦如柴的猫在房间里进进出出，用细长的粉红色舌头舔食地上的血迹。

We had to stop there until the ship came. I longed for something to focus my eyes on, there was nothing inside or out; no fields, houses, or roads; only vast quantities of stones, rubbish, the bones of dead animals. Stones of all shapes and sizes were spread thick all over the ground to a depth of two or three feet, often piled up in enormous mounds, which took the place of hills in a normal landscape. I managed to obtain a horse and rode ten miles inland, but the awful featureless scene did not change, the same derelict stony waste extended to the horizon in every direction, no sign of life or water. The whole country seemed stone dead, gray in color, no hills except hills of stones, even its natural contours destroyed by war. The girl was exhausted, worn out by travel: she did not want to go on. She kept saying that she must rest, begged me to leave her and continue the voyage alone. “Don’t drag me any further!” Her voice was fretful. “You only do it to torture me.” I replied that I was trying to save her. Anger showed in her eyes. “That’s what you say. I was fool enough to believe you the first time.” In spite of all attempts to please her, she persisted in treating me as a treacherous enemy. Hitherto I had tried to comfort, to understand. Now her protracted antagonism had its effect, I followed her into the tiny cabin. She struggled, there was no room, the boat rolled, she fell from the berth, her shoulder struck the floor and the soft flesh was hurt. She cried, “You’re a brute! A beast! I detest you!” tried to hit me, to struggle up; but I forced her under, forced her to stay down in that hard cold place. She cried out. “I wish I could kill you!” began to sob and struggle hysterically. I slapped the side of her face.  
我们必须在那儿停留，直到船来。我渴望能找到一些东西来集中注意力，但无论是里面还是外面，什么也没有；没有田野、房屋或道路，只有大量的石头、垃圾和动物的尸骨。各种形状和大小的石头厚厚地覆盖在地面上，深度达两三英尺，经常堆成巨大的土丘，代替了普通景观中的山丘。我设法弄到了一匹马，骑了十英里深入内陆，但那片可怕的无特征的景象没有变化，荒废的石头荒野在四面八方延伸至地平线，没有生命或水源的迹象。整个国家仿佛死了，灰色的，没有山丘，除了石头堆成的山丘，甚至连它的自然轮廓也被战争摧毁了。女孩已经筋疲力尽，长途跋涉使她精疲力尽，她不想继续前进了。她不断地说她必须休息，恳求我离开她，一个人继续航程。“别再拖着我了！”她的声音充满了焦躁。“你只是在折磨我。”我回答说我是在试图拯救她。她的眼中充满了愤怒。“那是你说的。我第一次就傻傻地相信了你。”尽管我努力去安慰她，去理解她，她却一直把我当作一个背信弃义的敌人。至今，我一直在试图安慰和理解她。现在，她持续的敌意影响了我，我跟着她进入了狭小的船舱。她挣扎着，没有空间，船在摇晃，她从床位上摔了下来，肩膀撞到了地板，柔软的肉体受到了伤害。她哭喊道：“你是个残暴的野兽！我讨厌你！”试图打我，挣扎着要起来；但我强行把她压在那冰冷坚硬的地方，让她待在那儿。她哭喊着：“我真希望能杀了你！”开始歇斯底里地哭泣和挣扎。我打了她的脸侧。

She was afraid of me, but her hostility continued unchanged. Her white, stubborn, frightened child’s face got on my nerves. She was still always cold, although the days were gradually getting warmer. She refused my coat. I was obliged to watch her incessant shivering.  
她害怕我，但她的敌意丝毫没有改变。她那苍白、倔强、带着恐惧的孩子般的脸让我感到烦躁。尽管天气逐渐回暖，她依然总是冷得发抖，拒绝穿我的外套。我只能眼睁睁地看着她不停地颤抖。

She grew emaciated, the flesh seemed to melt off her bones. Her hair lost its glitter, was too heavy, weighed her head down. She kept her head bent, trying not to see me. Listless, she hid in corners or, avoiding me, staggered round the ship, stumbling, her weak legs unable to balance. I no longer felt any desire, gave up talking to her, adopted the warden’s silences as my own. I was well aware how sinister my wordless exits and entrances must have seemed, and derived some satisfaction from this.  
她日渐消瘦，仿佛肉体从骨头上融化掉了。她的头发失去了光泽，显得沉重，使她的头不由自主地低垂着。她总是低着头，努力不去看我。她无精打采地躲在角落里，或者避开我，踉跄地在船上走动，虚弱的双腿难以保持平衡。我不再有任何欲望，放弃了与她交谈，采纳了看守的沉默。我清楚地知道自己那无言的进出对她有多么阴森，并从中获得了一些满足感。

We were near the end of the journey.  
我们的旅程已接近尾声。
