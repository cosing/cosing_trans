## THIRTEEN

They had built their headquarters far away from the battlefields, a large clean new building, flying a large clean flag. Stone and concrete, it stood out solid, massive, expensive, indestructible looking, among the low, old, rickety wooden houses. Apart from the sentries at the main entrance, it seemed to have nothing to do with war. No other guards were visible. Inside there appeared to be no security precautions at all. I recalled the commander’s drunken remark: perhaps these people really were too soft to fight; relying on their technological supremacy, on the gigantic size and wealth of their country, believed they need not dirty their hands with the actual fighting, paid their inferiors to do that.  
他们将总部建在远离战场的地方，一座干净崭新的大楼，悬挂着一面洁净的大旗。石材与混凝土构筑，使它在周围那些低矮、陈旧、摇摇欲坠的木房子中显得格外坚固、庞大、昂贵，仿佛不可摧毁。除了主入口的哨兵外，这里似乎与战争毫无关联，其他地方看不到任何警卫。进入内部后，几乎看不见任何安全防范措施。我想起指挥官醉酒时说的话：或许这些人真的太软弱了，无法战斗；他们依赖于技术上的优势，依赖于国家的庞大和富有，认为自己无需亲自上阵，花钱雇佣下属来代替他们浴血奋战。

I was directed to the warden’s suite. The place was air-conditioned. Elevators rose smoothly, silently, swiftly. Thick carpets stretched from wall to wall of the wide corridors. After the squalid discomfort in which I had been living, it was like a luxury hotel. Lights blazed everywhere in spite of the sunshine outside. Windows were hermetically sealed, not made to open. The resulting atmosphere was slightly unreal.  
我被引导到典狱长的套房。这里装有空调，电梯平稳、无声且迅速地上升。厚厚的地毯从宽敞走廊的一端铺到另一端。相比于我之前生活的肮脏困苦，这里简直如同奢华酒店。尽管外面阳光明媚，内部灯火通明。窗户完全密封，无法打开，整个环境带有一种略微不真实的感觉。

A woman secretary in uniform told me the warden could see no one. He was leaving immediately on a tour of inspection and would be away some days. I said: “I must see him before he goes. It’s urgent. I’ve come all this way specially. I won’t keep him a minute.” She pursed her lips, shook her head. “Absolutely impossible. He has important papers to sign and gave orders that nobody was to disturb him.” Her well made-up face was adamant, uncomprehending. It annoyed me. “To hell with that! I tell you I must see him! It’s a personal matter. Can’t you understand?” I wanted to shake her, to get some human expression into her face. Instead, I made my voice calm. “At least tell him I’m here and ask whether he’ll see me.” I felt in my pockets for some means of identification, then wrote my name on a pad. While I was doing so, a colonel came in. The secretary went over and whispered to him. At the end of their confabulation the man said he would give the message himself, took the paper with my name on it, and left the room by the same door through which he had just entered. I knew he had no intention of telling the warden about me. Only decisive action on my part would get me an interview. Soon it would be too late.  
一位穿着制服的女秘书告诉我，典狱长不能见任何人，他马上要去进行巡视，会离开几天。我说：“我必须在他走之前见他。这很紧急。我特意为此赶来，不会耽误他一分钟。”她抿紧嘴唇，摇了摇头：“绝对不可能。他有重要文件要签，并且下了命令，不准任何人打扰他。”她化妆精致的脸冷漠无情，毫无理解，这让我十分恼火。“见鬼去吧！我告诉你，我必须见他！这是私事，你难道听不懂吗？”我真想摇醒她，想让她脸上出现些许人性化的表情。最后，我让自己的声音冷静下来：“至少告诉他我来了，问问他能不能见我。”我在口袋里摸索着找证件，然后在纸上写下了我的名字。就在我写字的时候，一名上校进来了。秘书走过去低声对他说了几句。谈话结束后，那人说他会亲自传话，拿着写有我名字的纸，走出了刚才他进来的门。我知道他根本没打算告诉典狱长我的事。只有我采取果断行动，才能得到这次会面，再拖下去就太晚了。

“Where does that door lead?” I asked the secretary, pointing to one at the other end of the room. “Oh, that’s strictly private. You can’t go in there. It’s forbidden.” For the first time she began to lose her superior calm and to look flustered. She had not been trained to deal with a direct approach. I said: “Well, I’m going in,” moved toward the door. “No!” She flew to stand in front of it, barring my way. The country she belonged to was so firmly convinced of world power that its nationals could not conceive of real opposition from anyone, even over the smallest issue. I smiled, pushed her aside. She clung on to my clothes, holding me back. There was a brief scuffle. I heard a voice I recognized beyond the closed door. “What’s going on there?” I went in. “Oh, it’s you, is it?” He seemed singularly unsurprised. In the doorway the secretary was talking fast and apologetically. He waved her away. The door shut. I said: “I must speak to you.”  
“那扇门通向哪里？”我指着房间另一端的一扇门问秘书。“哦，那是私人区域，你不能进去，禁止入内。”她第一次失去了那种居高临下的冷静，显得有些慌乱。显然，她没有受过应对这种直接行为的训练。我说：“那我就进去看看，”便朝门走去。“不要！”她迅速冲到门前，挡住了我的去路。她所在的国家对其世界强权的信心如此坚固，以至于他们的国民无法想象来自任何人的真实反对，哪怕是最小的问题。我笑了笑，轻轻将她推到一边。她紧抓着我的衣服，试图阻止我。经过一番短暂的争执，我听到门后传来一个熟悉的声音：“外面发生了什么事？”我走了进去。“哦，是你啊？”他似乎毫不惊讶。站在门口的秘书急切而带着歉意地说着什么，他挥手让她离开，门随即关上了。我说道：“我必须和你谈谈。”

We were alone in the rich room. Persian rugs on the parquet floor, period furniture, on the wall a full-length portrait of him by a well-known painter. My worn, shabby, unpressed uniform emphasized, by contrast, the elegant grandeur of his, which had gold emblems on cuffs and shoulders, and, on the chest, the ribbons of various orders. He stood up; I had not remembered him as being so tall. The touch of the grand manner he had always had was more marked than when I last saw him. I was not at ease. His presence affected me in the usual way; but, with such obvious differences between us, the idea of contact, however obscure, seemed inappropriate and embarrassing. When he said coldly, “It’s no use forcing your way in here. I’m just leaving,” I felt confused, and could only repeat: “I must speak to you first.” “Impossible. I’m late as it is.” He glanced at his watch, started toward the door. “Surely you can wait just a moment!” In my anxiety, I hurriedly stepped in front of him. I should have known better. His eyes flashed; he was angry; I had thrown away my one chance. I cursed myself for a fool. Perhaps my downcast expression amused him: at all events, his attitude suddenly seemed to change, he half smiled. “I can’t hold up the entire war just to talk to you. If there’s something you must say, you’ll have to come with me.” I was delighted. This was better than anything I had expected. “May I? That’s wonderful!” I thanked him enthusiastically. He burst out laughing.  
我们独处在那奢华的房间里。拼花地板上铺着波斯地毯，房间内摆放着古典家具，墙上挂着一幅著名画家为他绘制的全身肖像。我的破旧、不整齐的军装与他的华丽制服形成了鲜明对比，他的袖口和肩膀上装饰着金色徽章，胸前挂着各种勋章的绶带。他站了起来，我记得他没那么高大，如今他的威仪更加显著，比我上次见他时更为明显。我感到不安，他的存在一如既往地让我紧张，但在我们之间如此明显的差距下，任何形式的接触，哪怕再微不足道，都显得不合时宜，令人尴尬。他冷冷地说：“你硬闯进来也没用，我正要走。”我感到困惑，只能重复道：“但我必须先和你谈谈。”“没可能，我已经晚了。”他说完看了看手表，开始向门口走去。“你肯定能等一小会儿吧！”我焦急地挡在他面前，心里明白不该这么做。他的眼神闪过一丝怒意，我惹怒了他，错失了唯一的机会。我暗骂自己愚蠢。或许是我沮丧的表情让他觉得好笑，总之，他的态度忽然发生了变化，嘴角微微露出一丝笑意。“我不能为了跟你说话就耽误整个战争。如果你真的有话要说，那就只能跟我一起走了。”我欣喜若狂，这比我预想的任何结果都要好得多。“可以吗？那太好了！”我满怀感激地谢过他，他突然放声大笑。

The road to the airfield was lined with people waiting to catch a glimpse of him as we drove past. They stood six deep at the roadside, watched from gardens, windows, balconies, roofs, trees, hoardings, telegraph poles. Some of them must have waited a long time. I was impressed by the force of his immediate impact on the crowd.  
通往机场的道路两旁挤满了等待一睹他风采的人群。他们在路边排了六层，站在花园里、窗户边、阳台上、屋顶上、树上、广告牌上，甚至是电线杆上。一些人肯定已经等了很久。他对人群产生的立刻震慑力让我深感震撼。

Sitting beside him in the plane, I was conscious of curious glances from its other occupants. It was strange to look down and see the earth, not flat or gently curved, but as a segment of a round ball, the sea light blue, the land yellowish-green. Overhead it was dark-blue night. Drinks were brought, I was handed a tinkling glass. “Ice! What luxury!” He glanced at my dilapidated uniform, made a grimace. “You can’t expect luxury if you insist on being a hero.” The words were mocking, but the smile had some degree of charm. He might even have been taking a friendly interest. “May I ask why you have suddenly become one of our heroic fighters?” I knew I should have spoken about a job. Instead, for some reason, I told him I’d had to do something drastic to cure my depression. “Funny sort of cure. More likely to kill you.” “Perhaps that’s what I wanted.” “No, you’re not the suicide type. Anyway, why bother, when we’re all going to be killed next week?” “As soon as that?” “Well, perhaps not literally. But certainly very soon.” I recognized the trick of blinking his eyes, making the bright blue pupils flash as if they reflected a dazzling blue light. It was the sign that something had not been said. Of course, he had secret information. He always knew everything before anyone else.  
坐在飞机上他身旁，我能感受到其他乘客好奇的目光。透过窗户往下看，地球并非平坦或微微弯曲，而是一段圆球的弧面，海洋呈浅蓝色，陆地则是淡黄绿色。头顶上是一片深蓝的夜空。饮品端了上来，我接过一杯冰块叮当作响的酒。“冰块！真是奢侈！”他瞥了一眼我破旧的军装，露出一丝苦笑。“你要坚持当英雄，可别指望享受奢侈。”他的语气带有嘲讽，但笑容却颇具几分魅力，甚至像是对我表现出些许友善的关心。“能问问你为什么突然成了我们这儿的英雄战士吗？”我本应该向他提工作的事，但不知为何，我却告诉他我不得不做点什么激烈的事来治愈我的抑郁症。“有趣的疗法，更有可能要了你的命。”“也许那就是我想要的。”“不，你不是自杀那类人。再说，何必费心呢，反正我们下周都会死。”“这么快？”“嗯，或许不是真的死，但肯定很快。”我认出他那眨眼的小伎俩，闪烁的蓝色瞳孔仿佛反射出耀眼的蓝光。这意味着还有话没说出来。显然，他掌握着机密情报。他总是比别人先知道一切。

An enormous dinner was served. It seemed altogether too lavish, I could not eat half of it. I had got out of the way of eating big meals. Afterward I tried again to say what I had come to say, but the sentences would not take shape in my head. I found myself thinking of him, and remarked on how little surprise he had shown over my arrival. “I was almost expecting you.” His expression was rather odd. “You have a way of turning up just before things happen.” He seemed to speak quite seriously. “You really expect the catastrophe within weeks or days?” “Looks like it.”  
一顿丰盛的晚餐被端上来，奢华得有些过分，我吃了一半都不到。我早已习惯了不吃这么丰盛的饭菜。之后，我又尝试说出自己来这里的目的，但那些话在脑海中依旧无法成形。我不自觉地想起他，便随口提到他对我的到来表现得毫不惊讶。  
“我差不多已经预料到你会来。”他露出了一种相当奇怪的表情。“你总是在事情发生前出现。”他的语气相当认真。  
“你真的认为灾难会在几周或几天内降临？”  
“看起来是的。”

Blinds were drawn, shutting out the sky. A film was to be shown. He muttered in my ear: “Wait till their attention’s fixed on the screen. Then I’ll show you something more interesting. It’s supposed to be kept secret.” I waited, curious. We left our seats quietly, went through a door, faced an uncovered window. I was confused about time. It had been night overhead all along, but below it was still daylight. There were no clouds. I saw islands scattered over the sea, a normal aerial view. Then something extraordinary, out of this world: a wall of rainbow ice jutting up from the sea, cutting right across, pushing a ridge of water ahead of it as it moved, as if the flat pale surface of sea was a carpet being rolled up. It was a sinister, fascinating sight, which did not seem intended for human eyes. I stared down at it, seeing other things at the same time. The ice world spreading over our world. Mountainous walls of ice surrounding the girl. Her moon-white skin, her hair sparkling with diamond prisms under the moon. The moon’s dead eye watching the death of our world.  
窗帘被拉上，遮住了天空，准备放映一部电影。他在我耳边低语：“等他们的注意力集中在屏幕上时，我会给你看一些更有趣的东西，这本该是保密的。”我充满好奇地等待着。我们悄悄离开座位，穿过一扇门，来到一扇没有遮挡的窗前。我对时间感到困惑，头顶一直是夜晚，但脚下仍是白昼，天空没有云。我看见海上散布着岛屿，俯瞰的视角一切如常。接着，一幕超乎现实的景象出现了：一道彩虹般的冰墙从海上突兀升起，横贯海面，推动着前方的水流，仿佛大海平坦苍白的表面像地毯一样被卷起。这是一幅既诡异又迷人的景象，仿佛不该被人类目睹。

我凝视着它，同时眼前浮现出其他的画面：冰的世界正向我们的世界蔓延。高耸的冰墙围绕着一个女孩。她月亮般苍白的皮肤，她的头发在月光下闪烁着钻石般的光芒。月亮那死寂的眼睛，注视着我们世界的毁灭。

When we left the plane we were in a remote country, a town I did not know. The warden had come to attend an important conference, people were waiting for him, all sorts of urgent affairs. I was flattered because he seemed in no hurry to leave me. He said: “You should have a look round, it’s an interesting place.” The town had only lately changed hands, and I asked if the troops had not done a lot of damage; received the reply: “Don’t forget some of us are civilized people.”  
当我们下了飞机时，已经到了一个偏远的地方，一个我不认识的小镇。典狱长是来参加一个重要的会议，很多人在等他，各种紧急事务需要处理。让我感到受宠若惊的是，他似乎并不急着离开我。他说道：“你应该四处看看，这个地方很有意思。”小镇最近才易手，我问他军队是否对这里造成了严重破坏，他答道：“别忘了，我们当中有些人还是文明人。”

In his splendid uniform he strolled beside me in beautifully kept gardens, attended by armed guards in black and gold. I was proud to be with him. He was a fine-looking man who kept himself in every way at the height of his powers, all his muscles exercised like an athlete’s, his intellect and his senses deliberately sharpened. He radiated tremendous dominance, besides an intense physical vitality, zest for living. His aura of power and success seemed to fill the surrounding air, and even extend to me. Walking past artificial cascades, we came to a lily pool where the stream widened. Giant willow trees trailed long green hair in the water, made an inviting grotto of cool green shade. We sat on a stone seat, watched a kingfisher tracing jeweled parabolas. Motionless gray shadows, herons stood here and there in the shallows. It was a private, peaceful, idyllic scene; violence was worlds away. I thought, but did not say, that it seemed a pity people were not allowed to enjoy all this tranquil beauty. As if he read my mind, he told me: “The public used to be admitted on certain days. But we had to suspend the practice on account of vandalism. Hooligans did the damage the armies refrained from doing. There are people you can’t teach to appreciate beauty. They’re subhuman.”  
他穿着华丽的制服，陪我漫步在修剪精美的花园中，身后是穿着黑金制服的武装卫兵。我为能与他同行而感到自豪。他是一个仪表堂堂的男人，无论在体力、智力还是感官上，都保持着最佳状态，像一名运动员般锻炼着每一块肌肉，刻意地磨砺着自己的智慧和感知。他散发出强大的主宰力，充满了蓬勃的生命力和对生活的热情。他那成功与权力的气场似乎充盈了周围的空气，甚至延伸到我身上。

我们走过人工瀑布，来到一处溪流变宽的睡莲池。巨大的柳树将长长的绿色枝条垂入水中，形成了一个凉爽的绿色阴影，仿佛是一个诱人的洞穴。我们坐在石椅上，看着翠鸟划出宝石般的抛物线。灰色的苍鹭在浅滩中静静伫立，宛如静止的影子。这里宁静私密，仿佛一个田园诗般的场景，暴力仿佛远在天边。我心里想，但没有说出口，这样的宁静美景却无法让人们分享，实在是一种遗憾。仿佛他读懂了我的想法，他对我说：“以前我们会在特定日子开放给公众。但由于破坏行为，不得不暂停了。那些流氓造成的破坏，甚至是军队都避免的。有些人就是无法学会欣赏美，他们不是完全的人类。”

On the far side of the river a troop of small gazelle-like creatures had come to drink, lifting and lowering graceful horned heads. The guards stood at a distance. Alone with my companion, I felt closer to him than ever before; we were like brothers, like identical twin brothers. Drawn to him more strongly than I had ever been, I had to give my feelings some expression, told him how much I appreciated his kindness, how greatly I was honored to be his friend. Something was wrong. He did not smile or acknowledge the compliment, but abruptly stood up. I got up too, while across the water the animals fled, alarmed by our movements. The atmosphere was changing round me; suddenly there was a chill, as if the warm air had passed over ice. I felt a sudden uncomprehended terror, like the sensation that comes in nightmares just before one begins to fall.  
河对岸，一群小型的羚羊般的动物前来饮水，优雅地抬起和低下长着角的头。卫兵们站得很远，我和他独处时，感到比以往任何时候都更加亲近；我们仿佛是兄弟，甚至像一对孪生兄弟。我被他强烈吸引，不得不给我的感受一些表达，于是告诉他我多么感激他的好意，能成为他的朋友是多大的荣幸。

有什么不对劲。他没有微笑，也没有回应我的称赞，反而突然站了起来。我也跟着起身，水对岸的动物因我们的动作而惊慌逃窜。周围的气氛在变化，突然有了一丝寒意，仿佛温暖的空气飘过冰面。我感到一种无法理解的恐惧，就像噩梦中即将坠落前的那种感觉。

In a moment he had turned on me, his eyes flashing blue danger, his face a grim mask. “Where is she?” His voice was fierce, curt, icy. It was as if he had whipped out a gun and pointed it at me. I was horrified; confused by the sudden switch from one emotion to another totally different, I could only stammer stupidly: “I suppose where I left her . . .” He gave me a look of ice. “You mean you don’t know?” His accusatory tone froze. I was too appalled to reply.  
瞬间，他转向我，眼中闪烁着蓝色的危险光芒，脸上戴着一副阴沉的面具。“她在哪儿？”他的声音冷酷、简短、冰冷，仿佛瞬间拔出了一把枪指向我。我惊恐万分，被他情绪的骤然转变弄得不知所措，只能愚蠢地结结巴巴回答：“我想……还在我留下她的地方吧……”他投来冰冷的一瞥：“你是说你不知道？”他那责问的语气令人心寒，我震惊得说不出话来。

The guards came closer, formed a circle round us. To shade their eyes, prevent recognition, or inspire dread, they wore as part of their uniform black plastic visors which covered the upper part of the face so that they looked masked. I vaguely remembered hearing about their toughness, that they were convicted thugs and murderers, whose sentences had been remitted in exchange for their absolute loyalty to his person.  
卫兵们靠近了，围成一个圈。他们的制服里有一部分是黑色的塑料面罩，遮住了脸的上半部分，像是带着面具，既可以遮挡阳光、防止被认出，也可以制造恐惧。我隐约记得听说过这些人的凶残，他们是被定罪的暴徒和杀人犯，为了绝对忠诚于他而减轻了刑罚。

“So you’ve abandoned her.” Arrows of blue ice piercing a blizzard, his eyes narrowed and struck. “I hardly expected that, even of you.” The abysmal contempt in his voice made me wince and mutter: “You know she’s always been hostile. She sent me away.” “You don’t know how to handle her,” he stated coldly. “I’d have licked her into shape. She only needs training. She has to be taught toughness, in life and in bed.” I could not speak, could not collect myself: I was in a state of shock. When he asked, “What do you propose to do about her?” I found nothing to say. His eyes were watching me all the time with a frigid scorn and remoteness that was too painful, too humiliating. Their blue blaze seemed to stop me thinking. “I shall take her back then.” In half a dozen dry words he disposed of her future, she had no say in the matter.  
“所以，你抛弃了她。”他的话如同蓝色冰箭穿透暴风雪，他的眼睛微微眯起，锐利地盯着我。“即便是你，我也没想到会如此。”他语气中的极度轻蔑让我不由得一颤，低声辩解：“你知道她一直对我充满敌意。是她赶我走的。”  
“你根本不知道该如何应对她，”他冷冷地说，“我早就能把她调教好。她只需要训练，不论是生活上还是床上，她都得学会坚韧。”  
我无法开口，无法整理自己的思绪，整个人陷入了震惊中。当他问道，“那你打算怎么处理她？”时，我竟无言以对。他的眼神一直带着冷酷的鄙视与疏远，那种令人难以承受的羞辱感让我无法思考。他那蓝色的目光仿佛冻结了我的思绪。“那我就接手她吧。”他用几句干巴巴的话就决定了她的未来，仿佛她毫无选择的权利。  

At that moment I was more concerned with him, linked to him so closely, as if we shared the same blood. I could not bear to be alienated from him. “Why are you so angry?” I went a step closer, tried to touch his sleeve, but he moved out of my reach. “Is it only because of her?” I could not believe this, the bond between him and myself seemed so strong. Just then she was nothing to me by comparison, not even real. We could have shared her between us. I may have said something of the kind. His face was carved in stone, his cold voice hard enough to cut steel, he was thousands of miles away. “As soon as I can make time I shall go and fetch her. And then keep her with me. You won’t see her again.”  
此刻，我心里更多的是在乎他，觉得我们如此紧密相连，仿佛同血脉相通。我无法忍受和他之间的疏远。“你为什么这么生气？”我向前迈了一步，试图触碰他的衣袖，但他躲开了我的手。“仅仅是因为她吗？”我无法相信，毕竟我们之间的联系如此牢固。相比之下，她在我心里根本微不足道，甚至显得不真实。我们本可以共同拥有她。我也许说出了类似的话。他的脸如石雕般冷峻，声音冷得足以割裂钢铁，仿佛已经远离千里。“一旦我有时间，我会去把她接回来，然后一直留在我身边。你再也不会见到她了。”

There was no bond, never had been, except in my imagination. He was not my friend, had never been close to me, identification was nothing but an illusion. He was treating me as someone beneath contempt. In a feeble attempt to re-establish myself, I said I had tried to save her. His eyes were terribly hard and blue, I could hardly meet them. His face was a statue’s, stony, it did not change. I forced myself to go on looking him in the face. Only his mouth finally moved to say: “She will be saved, if that’s possible. But not by you.” Then he turned and strolled off in his grand uniform with gold epaulets. A few paces away he paused, lit a cigarette, keeping his back toward me, strolled on again without giving me a glance. I saw him lift one hand and make a sign to the guards.  
原来从未有过什么联系，一切都只是我的幻想。他从来不是我的朋友，也从未和我亲近，所有的认同感不过是幻觉。他现在把我当成了一个不值一提的人。我试图勉强挽回自己的尊严，说我曾试图救她。他的眼神冷酷无情，蓝得刺目，我几乎无法与他对视。他的脸如同一尊石像，僵硬而冷漠，没有一丝变化。我强迫自己继续直视他的脸。终于，他的嘴微微动了，冷冷地说道：“如果她能得救，那也不会是因为你。”然后他转身走开了，身上那件镶有金肩章的华丽制服随他一同远去。走了几步，他停下脚步，点燃了一支烟，背对着我，继续漫步而去，甚至没有回头看我一眼。我看到他抬起一只手，向卫兵示意。

They closed in, inhuman in their black masks. Rubber truncheons crashed into me, I was kicked in the groin, in falling my head must have struck the stone seat, I passed out. This was lucky for me. Apparently it did not amuse them to beat an unconscious body. There was no sign of them when I came round. My head throbbed and rang, even to open my eyes was a fearful effort, every inch of my body ached, but nothing was broken. Pain confused me, made me uncertain of what had happened, of the length of time that had elapsed, of the sequence of events. In my confusion I could not understand being let off so lightly, until it occurred to me that the guards meant to come back later to finish the job. If they found me here I was done for. I could hardly move, but with infinite labor dragged myself down to the river, everything swaying round me, fell among rushes and lay for some time with my face in the mud.  
他们靠近了，带着黑色面罩，毫无人性。橡胶警棍重重砸在我身上，我的腹股沟被猛踢，倒下时头部似乎撞上了石椅，随即失去了意识。这对我来说倒是一种幸运，显然他们对殴打一个昏迷的人没什么兴趣。当我醒来时，周围已没有他们的踪影。我的头一阵阵地剧痛，耳朵嗡嗡作响，连睁开眼睛都成了一种艰难的尝试，全身每一处都疼痛不堪，但没有骨折。疼痛使我神志混乱，不确定到底发生了什么，也不清楚过了多久，更无法理清事情的顺序。在这种混沌中，我不理解为什么他们对我手下留情，直到我突然意识到，这些卫兵可能打算稍后回来结束这一切。如果他们在这里找到我，我就完了。我几乎无法动弹，但还是艰难地拖着自己挪到了河边，眼前的一切都在晃动，最后跌倒在芦苇丛中，脸埋进了泥里，躺了好一会儿。

When a far-off sound roused me it was almost dark. In the distance a semicircle of dark shapes was slowly advancing, as if searching. I got a fright, I thought they were people looking for me and kept quite motionless. They must have been animals grazing, for when I next looked up they had gone. The shock made me realize that I had to get moving. I crawled on to the water’s edge, let the river run over the wound in my head, washed another deep gash on my cheekbone, washed off some of the blood and mud.  
当远处的声音把我惊醒时，天几乎已经黑了。远处有一圈黑影缓慢靠近，仿佛在搜寻什么。我被吓了一跳，以为他们是在找我，便一动不动。后来再抬头时，那些影子已经消失了，想必是动物在觅食。这个惊吓让我意识到必须赶快离开。我爬到水边，让河水流过我头上的伤口，又清洗了颧骨上一道深深的伤口，洗去了一些血迹和泥土。

The cold water revived me. Somehow or other I managed to reach the park gates, even started walking along a street, but collapsed after a short distance. A carload of noisy young people coming back from a celebration saw me lying in the road and stopped to investigate. They thought I was one of their party who had fallen down drunk. I persuaded them to drive me to the hospital, where a doctor attended to me. I invented some story to account for my injuries and was given a bed in the casualty department. I slept for two or three hours. The clanging bell of an ambulance woke me. Stretcherbearers came tramping in. To move was appallingly difficult, all I wanted was to lie still and go on sleeping. But I knew it was too dangerous, I dared not stay any longer.  
冰冷的河水让我恢复了一些力气。我不知道怎么做到的，但我终于勉强到了公园的门口，甚至走上了街道，但没走多远就倒下了。一群庆祝归来的年轻人开车经过，看到我躺在路上，停下来查看。他们以为我是他们中的一员，喝醉了摔倒。我设法说服他们送我去医院，医生为我处理了伤口。我编了个故事解释我的伤情，被安排在急诊室的床上休息。我睡了两三个小时，直到救护车的铃声将我吵醒。担架员踏着沉重的步伐走进来。每移动一下都疼得厉害，我只想继续躺着，继续睡下去。但我知道太危险了，不能再待下去。

While the night staff were occupied with the new arrival, I crept through a side door into a dark corridor and left the building.  
当夜班工作人员忙着接待新来的客人时，我蹑手蹑脚地从一扇侧门进入黑暗的走廊，离开了大楼。
