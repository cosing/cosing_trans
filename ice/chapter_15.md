## FIFTEEN

An ice-cold air-stream hit me outside. Dusk was falling, the wind brought crumblings of frozen snow. I did not look for the short cut, but took a path I knew led down to the beach. Frost had killed off the exotic plants I remembered growing beside it: the leaves of palm trees were shriveled, moribund, blackened, furled tight like rolled umbrellas. I should have been inured to climatic changes; but I again felt I had moved out of ordinary life into an area of total strangeness. All this was real, it was really happening, but with a quality of the unreal; it was reality happening in quite a different way.  
一道冰冷的寒流迎面扑来。黄昏渐渐降临，风中夹带着冻雪的碎屑。我没有去找那条捷径，而是走上了一条熟悉的小路，通向海滩。霜冻已经杀死了我记忆中生长在路边的那些异域植物：棕榈树的叶子枯萎了，奄奄一息，变得焦黑，紧紧卷曲如同收起的伞。我本该对气候变化习以为常，但此刻我再次感到自己已经脱离了寻常的生活，进入了一个完全陌生的领域。所有这一切都是真实的，确实在发生，但却带有一种不真实的质感；仿佛现实正在以完全不同的方式展开。

Snow began to fall steadily, driven into my face by the arctic wind. The cold scorched my skin, froze my breath. To keep the snow out of my eyes I put on the heavy helmet. By the time the beach came in sight, a thick crust of ice had formed on the brim, making it still heavier. Through the white shifting curtain the house dimly appeared ahead; but I could not make out whether waves or a huge uneven expanse of pack ice lay beyond. It was heavy going against the wind. The snow thickened, inexhaustibly falling, incessantly sifting down, spreading a sheet of sterile whiteness over the face of the dying world, burying the violent and their victims together in a mass grave, obliterating the last trace of man and his works.  
雪开始稳稳地下着，被北极的寒风吹打在我的脸上。寒冷灼烧着我的皮肤，冻住了我的呼吸。为了挡住风雪，我戴上了沉重的头盔。不久，帽檐上已经结了一层厚厚的冰壳，使它变得更加沉重。透过白茫茫的雪幕，我隐约看到了前方的房子；但我无法辨别出那是波涛还是一片巨大的浮冰。在风雪中前行变得愈发艰难，雪越下越大，无穷无尽地落下，不停地筛落，像一张白色的寒毯铺展在垂死的世界上，将暴徒和受害者一起掩埋进一座集体坟墓，抹去人类与他们所有创造的最后痕迹。

Suddenly, through the churning white, I saw the girl running away from me, toward the ice. I tried to shout, “Stop! Come back!” but the polar air corroded my throat, my voice was whirled away by the wind. Snow powder blowing round me like mist, I ran after her. I could hardly see her, hardly see out of my eyes: I had to pause, painfully wipe away the crystals of ice forming on my eyeballs, before I could continue. The murderous wind kept hurling me back, the snow heaped up white hills that fumed like volcanoes, blinding me again with white smoke. In the awful dead cold I lurched on, staggered and stumbled, slipped, fell, struggled up, reached her somehow at last, clutched her with numbed hands.  
突然，透过翻腾的白雪，我看到那个女孩朝着冰面奔去。我试图喊道，“停下！回来！”但极地的寒气腐蚀了我的喉咙，声音被风卷走。雪粉像雾一样在我周围飘荡，我追了上去。我几乎看不清她，也看不清前方的路：不得不停下来，痛苦地擦掉在眼球上凝结的冰晶，才能继续前行。凶猛的风不断将我推回，雪堆积成白色的小山，像火山一样喷发出白烟，再次遮住了我的视线。在这可怕的死寂寒冷中，我踉踉跄跄地向前，跌跌撞撞，滑倒，摔倒，又挣扎着站起来，终于在某个时刻抓住了她，用那早已冻僵的手紧紧地握住她。

I was too late, I saw at once that we had no chance. A mirage-like arctic splendor towered all around, a weird, unearthly architecture of ice. Huge ice-battlements, rainbow turrets and pinnacles, filled the sky, lit from within by frigid mineral fires. We were trapped by those encircling walls, a ring of ghostly executioners, advancing slowly, inexorably, to destroy us. I could not move, could not think. The executioner’s breath paralyzed, dulled the brain. I felt the fatal chill of the ice touch me, heard its thunder, saw it split by dazzling emerald fissures. Far overhead the iceberg-glittering heights boomed and shuddered, about to fall. Frost glimmered on her shoulders, her face was ice-white, the long eyelashes swept her cheek. I held her close, clasped her tightly against my chest, so that she should not see the mountainous masses of falling ice.  
我已经太迟了，一眼就看出我们没有任何机会。四周环绕着如海市蜃楼般的极地辉煌，那是一种奇异、超凡的冰之建筑。巨大的冰墙、彩虹般的塔楼和尖顶充满了天空，从内透出寒冷的矿物之火。我们被这些环绕的冰墙困住了，如同幽灵般的刽子手，缓慢而不可阻挡地向我们逼近，准备摧毁我们。我无法动弹，无法思考。刽子手的气息麻痹了我的大脑，冰冷的死亡触觉让我感到致命的寒意，耳边响起雷鸣般的轰响，我看见冰层被炫目的翡翠裂缝分割。高空中的冰山闪烁着，轰然震动，随时可能崩塌。她的肩上泛着霜光，脸色如冰雪般苍白，长长的睫毛轻扫过她的脸颊。我紧紧抱住她，把她牢牢地贴在我的胸前，好让她不看到那些即将坠落的冰山巨块。

In her gray loden coat, she stood on the verandah surrounding the beach house, waiting for someone. At first I thought she had seen me coming, then realized that her eyes were fixed on a different path. I stopped and stood watching. I wanted to make sure who it was she expected, although I did not think the hotel man was likely to come now, knowing I would be here. She seemed to feel she was no longer alone, started looking about, and finally saw me. I was not close enough to distinguish the dilating pupils that made her eyes huge and black in her white face. But I heard her sharp exclamation, saw the hair swirl and glint as she swung round, pulled the hood over her head, and started toward the beach. I could hardly see her once she was off the verandah. She was trying to become invisible in the snow. Sudden terror had seized her: the thought of the man whose ice-blue eyes had a magnetic power which could deprive her of will and thrust her down into hallucination and horror. The fear she lived with, always near her, close behind the world’s normal façade, had become concentrated on him. And there was another connected with him, they were in league together, or perhaps they were the same person.  
她穿着灰色的粗呢外套，站在环绕海滩小屋的阳台上，等待着某人。起初我以为她已经看见了我过来，但随后意识到，她的目光固定在另一条小路上。我停下脚步，站在那里观察她。我想确定她究竟在等谁，尽管我不认为旅馆的那个人会来，因为他知道我已经到了。她似乎感到自己不再孤单，开始环顾四周，终于看到了我。我离得太远，看不清她眼中因瞳孔放大而显得异常巨大、黝黑的样子，但我听到了她一声尖锐的惊呼，看到她的头发在转身时旋转闪光，她拉起兜帽，朝海滩走去。一旦离开阳台，我几乎看不见她了。她试图在雪中隐身。突然的恐惧抓住了她：那个冰蓝色眼睛的男人，他的目光有一种磁力，能够剥夺她的意志，将她推入幻觉与恐怖之中。她一直生活在这种恐惧中，恐惧总是在她身边，紧紧跟随着世界表象的背后。而这个恐惧集中在他身上，且与另一个人有关，他们合谋，或者他们根本就是同一个人。

Both of them persecuted her, she did not understand why. But she accepted the fact as she accepted all the things that happened to her, expecting to be ill-treated, to be made a victim, ultimately to be destroyed, either by unknown forces or by human beings. This fate seemed always to have been waiting for her, ever since time began. Only love might have saved her from it. But she had never looked for love. Her part was to suffer; that was known and accepted. Fatality brought resignation. It was no use fighting against her fate. She knew she had been beaten before the start.  
他们两个一直折磨她，她却始终不明白原因。但她接受了这个事实，正如她接受了生活中所有发生在自己身上的事情。她习惯于被虐待，成为受害者，最终被毁灭——无论是来自未知力量还是人类的手段。这种命运仿佛自时间之初就一直在等待着她。只有爱也许能将她拯救，但她从未期待过爱。她的角色是受苦，这是众所周知并被她接受的事实。命运带来了顺从，抵抗是徒劳的。她早就知道自己在起点之前就已经输掉了这场战斗。

She had gone only a few steps when I overtook her and pulled her back to the shelter of the verandah. Wiping the snow off her face, she exclaimed, “Oh, it’s you,” stared at me in surprise. “Who did you think it was?” I remembered the uniform I was wearing. “These clothes aren’t mine, by the way. I borrowed them.” Her apprehension vanished, she showed relief, her manner became quite different, suddenly she seemed self-possessed. I was familiar with the air of confidence and independence she could assume when people or circumstances made her feel secure. The young man at the hotel must have done this. “Let’s go in quickly. Why are we standing here?” She spoke casually, acted as though my return had been planned and expected, pretending there was nothing unusual about the situation. It was annoying, after all I had been through. I knew it was meant to make me feel small.  
她才走了几步，我就追上了她，把她拉回到了走廊的避风处。我帮她擦去脸上的雪，她惊呼道：“哦，是你啊。”然后惊讶地看着我。“你以为是谁？”我突然想起自己穿着的制服，说：“这衣服不是我的，我是借的。”她的戒备消失了，露出了如释重负的神情，举止也变得完全不同，突然之间她显得很镇定自若。我对她这种在感到安全时表现出的自信与独立的样子十分熟悉，看来酒店的那个年轻人让她产生了这样的感觉。“快进去吧，我们为什么还站在这里？”她随口说道，仿佛我的归来是早已计划好并意料中的事情，假装这一切并不特殊。这让我感到恼火，毕竟我经历了那么多，而她的态度似乎故意让我感到微不足道。

She led the way to her door, invited me in with a social gesture. The little room was bare and cold, an old-fashioned oil heater barely took off the chill. But everything was clean and tidy, I saw that affectionate care had been expended, there were decorations of driftwood and shells from the beach. “I’m afraid it’s not very comfortable; not up to your standard.” She was trying to make fun of me. I said nothing. She undid her coat and put back the hood, shaking her hair free. It had grown longer, sparkled and shimmered with life. Under the coat she was wearing an expensive-looking gray suit I had not seen, which had evidently been made to measure. So she had not been short of money. To see her looking attractive and well dressed for some reason added to my annoyance.  
她走在前面，带我到了她的门口，用一个礼貌的手势邀请我进去。那间小屋简陋而寒冷，旧式的油炉几乎无法驱散寒意。但所有东西都整洁干净，我看得出她花了心思，房间里装饰着从海滩捡来的浮木和贝壳。“恐怕这里不太舒服，不符合你的标准。”她带着调侃的语气说道。我没有回答。她解开外套，放下帽子，甩开了头发。她的头发比以前长了，闪烁着生机。在外套下，她穿着一套我没见过的灰色昂贵套装，显然是量身定做的。看来她并不缺钱。看到她这样精致、穿得体面，反而莫名地加深了我的恼火。

Like a conventional hostess making conversation, she said: “It’s nice to have a place of one’s own after so much traveling about.” I stared at her. I had come so far to find her, through so many deaths and dangers and difficulties: now at last I had reached her; and she was talking to me like a stranger. It was too much. I felt hurt and resentful. Exasperated by her offhand pose and her determination to deprive my arrival of its importance, I said indignantly: “Why are you putting on this act? I didn’t come all this way just to be treated as a casual caller.”  
她像个普通的女主人一样随意地说道：“在经历了那么多的奔波之后，有一个自己的地方真是不错。”我盯着她看。我经过那么多的死亡、危险和困难，千辛万苦才找到她；而现在，她却像对待一个陌生人一样和我说话。这实在太过分了。我感到受伤和不满。她那漫不经心的姿态和刻意淡化我到来的重要性，让我愤怒不已。我不满地说道：“你为什么要装出这一副样子？我可不是大老远跑来只为了被当作一个随便拜访的客人。”

“Did you expect me to put out the red carpet for you?” The feeble flippant retort sounded offensive. I was becoming angry, knew I would not be able to control myself much longer. When, still keeping up the farce, she inquired in the same artificial tone what I had been doing, I answered coldly: “I’ve been with someone you know,” giving her a long, hard, meaning look at the same time. She understood at once, dropped her affectations and showed signs of anxiety. “When I first saw you . . . I thought you . . . he . . . I was afraid he’d arrived here.” “He will be here at any moment. I came to tell you that. To warn you, in case you have other plans, that he means to get you back—” She interrupted, “No, no—never!” shaking her head so vigorously that the hair flew out with a sheen like spray. I said: “Then you must leave immediately. Before he comes.”  
“你以为我会给你铺上红地毯吗？”她那虚弱又轻佻的反驳显得令人厌烦。我开始生气，感觉自己快要控制不住了。当她依旧装模作样，用同样做作的语气问我最近在做什么时，我冷冷地回答：“我和你认识的一个人在一起，”同时狠狠地盯了她一眼。她立刻明白了，所有的伪装瞬间消失，露出焦虑的神情。“当我第一次看到你时……我以为你是……他……我担心他已经来了。”  
“他随时都会到。我来是为了告诉你这个消息，提醒你，如果你有其他打算的话，他是决不会放过你的——”  
她猛然打断我，拼命摇着头，头发如喷雾般闪耀，“不，不——绝不！”  
我说道：“那你必须马上离开。在他到来之前。”  

“Leave here?” It was cruel. She looked round in dismay at the home she had made. The sea shells comforted, the little room was so reassuring, so safe, the one place on earth she could call her own. “But why? He’ll never find me . . .” Her wistful, pleading voice did not touch me; mine remained adamant, cold. “Why not? I found you.” “Yes, but you knew . . .” She looked at me with suspicion, I was not to be trusted. “You didn’t tell him, did you?” “Of course not. I want you to come with me.”  
“离开这里？”她的声音充满痛苦。她环顾四周，望着自己精心打造的家，满是失望。海贝让她感到安慰，这个小小的房间如此安全，是她在世上唯一能称作自己的地方。“为什么？他永远找不到我……”她那带着恳求的声音并没有打动我，我的语气依然坚定而冰冷。“为什么找不到？我都能找到你。”  
“是的，但你知道……”她用怀疑的眼神看着我，显然不再信任我。“你没告诉他吧？”  
“当然没有。我是想让你跟我走。”

All of a sudden her confidence was restored, she reverted to her former disparaging attitude, gave me a derisive glance. “With you? Oh, no! Surely we haven’t got to go through all that again!” Attempting sarcasm, she rolled her big eyes, turned them up to the ceiling. It was a deliberate insult. I was outraged. Her slighting tone belittled my desperate efforts to reach her, ridiculed everything I had endured. In a furious rage suddenly, I took hold of her roughly, gave her a violent shake. “Stop it, will you! I can’t stand any more! Stop being so damned insulting! I’ve just been through hell for your sake, traveled hundreds of miles under ghastly conditions, run fantastic risks, almost got myself killed. And not the slightest sign of appreciation from you . . . not one word of thanks at the end of it . . . you don’t even treat me with ordinary common politeness . . . I only get a cheap sneer . . . Charming gratitude! Charming way to behave!” She was gazing at me speechlessly, her eyes all black pupil. My rage did not become any less. “Even now you haven’t got the decency to apologize!”  
她的自信突然恢复，重新变回了之前那种轻蔑的态度，嘲讽地瞥了我一眼。“跟你走？哦，不！难道我们还要再经历这一切吗？”她试图用讽刺的口吻，翻了翻大眼睛，朝天花板望去。这是赤裸裸的侮辱，我被激怒了。她那轻蔑的语气贬低了我为接近她所付出的绝望努力，嘲笑了我所经历的一切痛苦。

我瞬间陷入暴怒，粗暴地抓住她，用力摇晃她。“够了！我受够了！别再这么侮辱人了！我为了你刚从地狱回来，冒着极端恶劣的条件走了几百英里，经历了无数危险，差点送命。而你连一句感谢的话都没有……连最起码的礼貌都没有……我只得到一个廉价的嘲笑……真是好极了的感恩方式！好极了的表现！”她默默地望着我，瞳孔几乎占满了她的眼睛。

我的怒火丝毫未减，“即使到现在，你连一个道歉的起码体面都没有！”

Still infuriated, I went on abusing her, called her insufferable, impertinent, insolent, vulgar. “In future you might at least be civil enough to thank people who do things for you, instead of displaying your stupid conceited rudeness by laughing at them!” She seemed stricken, dumb; stood before me in silence, with hanging head, all trace of assurance gone. In the last few moments she had become a withdrawn, frightened, unhappy child, damaged by adult deviations.  
我依然愤怒，继续对她大加指责，称她为无法忍受、无礼、傲慢、粗俗的人。“以后你至少应该有点礼貌，感谢那些为你做事的人，而不是用你愚蠢、自负的无礼行为嘲笑他们！”她仿佛受到了打击，一言不发地站在我面前，低着头，所有的自信都消失了。就在这短短几分钟内，她变成了一个退缩的、害怕的、不幸的孩子，仿佛被成年人的偏离所伤害。

A pulse at the base of her neck caught my eye, beating rapidly like something under the skin trying to escape. I had noticed it on other occasions when she was frightened. It had its usual effect on me now. I said loudly: “What a fool I’ve been to worry about you. I suppose you moved in with your boyfriend as soon as I left.” She looked up at me quickly, apprehensively, stammered: “What do you mean?” “Oh, don’t pretend you don’t understand—it’s too sickening!” My voice sounded aggressive, got louder and louder. “I mean the owner of this house, of course. The fellow you’re living with. The one you were waiting for on the verandah when I arrived.” I could hear myself shouting. The noise terrified her. She had begun to tremble, her mouth was shaking. “I was not waiting for him—” She saw what I was doing, broke off. “Don’t lock the door . . .” I had locked it already. Everything had turned to iron, to ice, to hard, cold, burning impatience. I grasped her shoulders, pulled her toward me. She resisted, cried, “Keep away from me!” kicked, struggled, her hand shot out, dislodging a bowl of delicate wing-shaped shells, which smashed on the floor: our feet ground them to rainbow powder. I forced her down, crushed her under the bloodstained tunic, the sharp buckle of the uniform belt caught her arm. Blood beading the soft white flesh . . . the iron taste of blood in my mouth . . .  
她颈部底下的脉搏突然吸引了我的目光，快速地跳动着，仿佛有什么东西在皮肤下挣扎，想要逃脱。我之前在她害怕时也注意到过这一点，现在它又对我产生了同样的影响。我大声说：“我真是个傻瓜，竟然为你担心。我猜我一走你就和你的男朋友搬到一起了吧。”她迅速抬头看着我，带着恐惧，结结巴巴地问：“你是什么意思？”“哦，别假装你不明白——真是恶心！”我的声音充满了攻击性，越来越大声。“我说的当然是这个房子的主人。你现在和他住在一起的人。就是你在我到来时等在阳台上的那个人。”我听到自己的声音在喊叫，这声音吓坏了她。她开始颤抖，嘴唇在颤动。“我不是在等他——”她看出了我的意图，突然停住了。“不要锁门……”可我已经把门锁上了。空气仿佛瞬间凝固成了冰冷的铁，变成了一种硬冷而燃烧的急躁。我抓住她的肩膀，把她拉向我。她挣扎着，哭喊道：“离我远点！”她踢打、挣扎，手伸出，打翻了一碗精致的贝壳，贝壳碎在地上，我们的脚踩在上面，碾成了彩虹般的粉末。我强行将她压倒在地，血迹斑斑的军服压在她身上，制服腰带上的锋利扣子划伤了她的手臂。血珠渗出她柔软白皙的皮肤……铁锈味的血在我嘴里蔓延……

She lay silent, unmoving, avoiding me by turning her face to the wall. Perhaps because I could not see her face, she seemed like someone I did not know. I felt nothing whatever about her, all feeling had left me. I had said I could not stand any more, and that was the truth. I could not go on; it was all too humiliating, too painful. I had wanted to finish with her in the past, but had been unable to do so. Now the moment had come. It was time to get up and go, to end the whole wretched business. I had let it go on far too long, it had always been painful and unrewarding. She did not move when I stood up. Neither of us said a word. We were like two strangers accidentally in the same room. I was not thinking. All I wanted was to get into the car and drive and drive, until I was somewhere far away where I could forget all this. I left the room without looking at her or speaking, and went out into the arctic cold.  
她静静地躺着，一动不动，脸转向墙壁，避开我的目光。或许是因为我看不见她的脸，她仿佛成了一个陌生人。我对她没有任何感觉，所有的情感都已经离开了我。我曾说过我再也无法忍受，那是事实。我不能再继续下去了，一切都太屈辱，太痛苦了。过去我曾想结束和她的关系，但却无法做到。现在时机终于到了。是时候站起来走了，结束这场令人痛苦不堪的闹剧。我让这一切持续得太久了，它一直都只是痛苦，没有任何回报。当我站起来时，她没有任何反应。我们谁也没有说话，仿佛是两个偶然出现在同一个房间里的陌生人。我没有思考，唯一的想法就是开车离开，开得远远的，直到我可以把这一切忘掉。我没有看她，也没有说话，径直离开了房间，走进了北极般的寒冷中。

Outside it had got quite dark. I paused on the verandah for my eyes to get used to the blackness. By degrees the snow became visible as it fell, a sort of faint shimmer like phosphorescence. The hollow roar of the wind came in irregular bursts, the snowflakes whirled madly in all directions, filled the night with their spectral chaos. I seemed to feel the same feverish disorder in myself, in all my pointless rushing from place to place. The crazily dancing snowflakes represented the whole of life. Her image flew past, the silver hair streaming, and was instantly swept away in the wild confusion. In the delirium of the dance, it was impossible to distinguish between the violent and the victims. Anyway, distinctions no longer mattered in a dance of death, where all the dancers spun on the edge of nothing.  
外面已经完全黑了下来。我在门廊上停留片刻，让眼睛适应黑暗。渐渐地，飘落的雪显现出淡淡的光辉，仿佛微弱的磷光。狂风时断时续地发出空洞的咆哮，雪花在空中疯狂地旋转，填满了这夜晚的幽灵般的混乱。我似乎在自己身上也感受到了一种同样的狂乱，在我毫无意义的四处奔波中。这些疯狂舞动的雪花仿佛象征着整个生命。她的身影一晃而过，银色的长发飞扬，瞬间便被卷入了这疯狂的混沌之中。在这死亡的舞蹈中，暴力者与受害者已经无法分辨。无论如何，在这濒临虚无的旋转中，所有的区别早已不再重要。

I had grown used to the feeling that I was going toward execution. It was something in the distance, an idea with which I had become familiar. Now it suddenly sprang at me, stood close at my elbow, no longer an idea, but a reality, just about to happen. It gave me a shock, a physical sensation in the pit of the stomach. The past had vanished and become nothing; the future was the inconceivable nothingness of annihilation. All that was left was the ceaselessly shrinking fragment of time called “now.”  
我已经习惯了那种走向行刑的感觉。它一直是个遥远的念头，一个我早已熟悉的想法。而现在，它突然扑向我，紧贴着我的肩膀，不再是一个念头，而是即将发生的现实。这让我感到一阵震惊，一种从胃底涌起的生理反应。过去已消失，化为虚无；未来则是难以想象的毁灭般的虚无。所剩下的，只有那个不断缩小的时间碎片，名为“现在”。

I remembered the dark-blue sky of noon and midnight which I had seen above, while below a wall of rainbow ice moved over the ocean, round the globe. Pale cliffs looming, radiating dead cold, ghostly avengers coming to end mankind. I knew the ice was closing in round us, my own eyes had seen the ominous moving wall. I knew it was coming closer each moment, and would go on advancing until all life was extinct.  
我想起那深蓝色的天空，无论是正午还是午夜都悬挂在头顶，而在下面，一堵彩虹般的冰墙在海面上移动，环绕着整个地球。苍白的冰崖隐隐浮现，散发着死亡般的寒冷，如幽灵般的复仇者，前来终结人类。我知道冰已经在我们周围合拢，我亲眼目睹了那不祥的移动冰墙。我清楚它每时每刻都在逼近，直至所有生命灭绝。

I thought of the girl I had left in the room behind me, a child, immature, a glass girl. She had not seen, did not understand. She knew she was doomed, but not the nature of her fate, or how to face it. No one had ever taught her to stand alone. The hotel proprietor’s son had not impressed me as particularly reliable or protective, but rather a weak unsatisfactory type, and disabled as well. I did not trust him to look after her when the crisis came. I saw her, defenseless and terrified, amidst the collapsing mountains of ice; above the crashes and thunder, heard her feeble pathetic cries. Knowing what I knew, I could not leave her alone and helpless. She would suffer too much.  
我想到身后房间里的那个女孩，一个孩子，未成熟的，仿佛是玻璃做成的女孩。她没有看见，也不明白。她知道自己命中注定要灭亡，却不了解命运的本质，也不懂得如何去面对。没有人教过她如何独自站立。旅店老板的儿子并没有给我留下可靠或保护她的印象，反而显得软弱、不称职，而且还有残疾。我不信任他在危机到来时能照顾好她。我看见她无助又恐惧地置身于崩塌的冰山之中；在那轰隆作响的冰崩之上，隐约听到她那微弱而可怜的哭声。知道这一切的我，不能让她孤身一人，无法自保。她会遭受太多的痛苦。

I went back indoors. She did not seem to have moved, and although she looked round when I came into the room, at once twisted away again. She was crying and did not want me to see her face. I went close to the bed, stood there without touching her. She looked pathetic, cold, shivering, her skin had the same faint mauve tinge as some of the shells. It was too easy to hurt her. I said quietly: “I must ask you something. I don’t care how many different men you’ve slept with—it’s not about that. But I must know why you were so insulting to me just now. Why have you been trying to humiliate me ever since I arrived?” She would not look round, I thought she was not going to answer; but then, with long gaps between the words, she brought out: “I wanted . . . to get . . . my . . . own . . . back . . .” I protested: “But what for? I’d only just got here. I hadn’t done anything to you.”  
我又回到了屋内。她似乎没有动过，虽然在我进屋时她转头看了一眼，却立刻又扭身避开了。她在哭，不想让我看见她的脸。我走到床边，站在那里，没有触碰她。她看起来可怜又寒冷，瑟瑟发抖，皮肤带着像某些贝壳那样的淡淡紫色。伤害她实在太容易了。我轻声说道：“我得问你一件事。我不在乎你和多少男人睡过——这和那个无关。但我必须知道，为什么你刚才对我那么侮辱？自从我到这儿以来，你为什么一直想羞辱我？”她依旧不肯回头，我以为她不会回答了；但接着，她断断续续地说：“我想要……找回……属于我的……”我抗议道：“可为什么呢？我刚到这里，我什么都没做。”

“I knew . . .” I had to bend over her to catch the accusing voice, speaking through tears. “Whenever I see you, I always know you’ll torment me . . . kick me around . . . treat me like some sort of slave . . . if not at once, in an hour or two, or next day . . . you’re sure to . . . you always do . . .” I was startled, almost shocked. The words presented a view of myself I much preferred not to see. I hurriedly asked her another question. “Who were you waiting for on the verandah, if it wasn’t the hotel fellow?” Once more a totally unexpected answer disconcerted me. “For you . . . I heard the car . . . I thought . . . I wondered . . .” This time I was astounded, incredulous. “But that can’t possibly be true—not after what you’ve just said. Besides, you didn’t know I was coming. I don’t believe it.”  
“我知道……” 我不得不俯身靠近她，才能听清那带着指责的声音，透过泪水说出来。“每次看到你，我总是知道你会折磨我……把我踢来踢去……把我当成某种奴隶对待……如果不是马上，那就过一两个小时，或者明天……你肯定会的……你总是这样……” 这些话让我震惊，几乎吓了一跳。她描绘出的那个我，是我极不愿意面对的。我急忙转移话题，问了她另一个问题：“如果不是那个旅馆的小伙子，那你在阳台上等谁？” 她的回答再次出乎我的意料，让我更加不安：“等你……我听到了车声……我以为……我在猜……” 这次我简直不敢相信，感到难以置信。“但这不可能是真的——在你刚才说的那些话之后。况且你也不知道我要来。我不信。”

She twisted round wildly, sat up, flung back the mass of pale hair, showed her desolate victim’s face, features dissolved in tears, eyes black as if set in bruises. “It is true, I tell you, whether you believe it or not! I don’t know why . . . you’re always so horrible to me . . . I only know I’ve always waited . . . wondered if you’d come back. You never sent any message . . . but I always waited for you . . . stayed here when the others left so that you’d be able to find me . . .” She looked a desperate child, sobbing out the truth. But what she said was so incredible that I said again: “It’s not possible—it can’t be true.” Face convulsed, she gasped in a voice choked by tears: “Haven’t you had enough yet? Can’t you ever stop bullying me?”  
她疯狂地转过身，坐起身来，猛地甩开那一头淡色的头发，露出一张悲凉的受害者的脸，五官被泪水冲刷得模糊，眼睛黑得像陷入瘀伤之中。“这是真的，我告诉你，不管你信不信！我不知道为什么……你总是对我这么残忍……我只知道我一直在等……在猜你会不会回来。你从来没有发过消息……但我一直等你……当其他人都走了，我还留在这里，好让你能找到我……”她看起来像个绝望的孩子，抽泣着说出了真相。但她的话实在是太不可思议了，我再次说道：“不可能——这不是真的。”她的脸因痛苦而扭曲，泪水哽住了她的声音，她喘息着说：“你还没够吗？你难道就不能停止欺负我吗？”

Suddenly I felt ashamed, muttered: “I’m sorry . . .” I wished I could somehow obliterate past words and actions. She had thrown herself down again, flat on her face. I stood looking at her, not knowing what to say. The situation seemed to have gone beyond words. In the end I could think of nothing better than: “I didn’t come back only to ask those questions, you know.” There was no response at all. I was not even sure she had heard me. I stood waiting, while the sobs slowly died away. In the silence, I watched the pulse in her neck, still beating fast, presently put out my hand, gently touched the spot with the tip of one finger, then let the hand fall. A skin like white satin, hair the color of moonlight . . .  
忽然间，我感到羞愧，低声说：“对不起……” 我希望能够抹去过去说过的话和做过的事。她再次趴倒在地，脸朝下。我站在那里看着她，不知道该说些什么。这种情况似乎已经超出了语言的范围。最后，我只能想到一句：“你知道，我回来并不是只为了问这些问题。” 但她完全没有反应。我甚至不确定她是否听见了。我站在那里等待着，听着她的抽泣声慢慢消失。在寂静中，我注视着她颈部的脉搏，仍在快速跳动。我伸出手指轻轻碰了一下那个地方，然后让手无力地垂下。她的皮肤像白色的缎子，头发的颜色如同月光......

Slowly she turned her head toward me without a word; her mouth appeared out of the shining hair, then her wet brilliant eyes, glittering between long lashes. Now she had stopped crying; but at intervals a shudder, a soundless gasp, interrupted her breathing, like an interior sob. She did not say anything. I waited. The seconds passed. When I could not wait any longer, I asked softly: “Are you coming with me? I promise I won’t bully you any more.” She did not answer, so after a moment I was obliged to add: “Or do you want me to go?” Abruptly she sat up straight, made a distraught movement, but still did not speak. I waited again: tentatively held out my hands; lived through another long silence, interminable suspense. At last she gave me her hands. I kissed them, kissed her hair, lifted her off the bed.  
她慢慢地转过头来看着我，一言不发。她的嘴从那闪亮的头发里露了出来，接着是那双湿润的、在长睫毛间闪烁的明亮眼睛。她已经停止了哭泣，但不时有一种无声的颤抖打断她的呼吸，像是内心的抽泣。她没有说话，我在等待。秒针一秒一秒地过去。当我再也无法等待时，轻声问道：“你愿意和我走吗？我保证再也不会欺负你了。” 她仍然没有回答，于是我不得不补充道：“或者你想让我走？” 她突然直起身，做了一个困扰的动作，但依旧没有开口。我再次等待，小心翼翼地伸出了手，在漫长的沉默中，忍受着无尽的悬念。终于，她把手交给了我。我轻轻吻着她的手，吻着她的头发，把她从床上抱了起来。

While she was getting ready I stood at the window, staring out at the snow. I was wondering whether I ought to tell her that I had seen the sinister ice-wall approaching across the sea, and that in the end it was bound to destroy us and everything else. But my thoughts were muddled and inconclusive and I reached no decision.  
她准备的时候，我站在窗前，凝视着外面的雪。我在思考是否该告诉她，我曾看到那片阴森的冰墙正从海上逼近，最终它会摧毁我们和一切。但我的思绪混乱不清，没能做出任何决定。

She said she was ready, and went to the door; stopped there, looking back at the room. I saw her psychologically bruised face, her extreme vulnerability, her unspoken fears. This little room the one friendly familiar place. Everything outside terrifyingly strange. The huge alien night, the snow, the destroying cold, the menacing unknown future. Her eyes turned to me, searched my face: a heavy, doubting, reproachful look, accusing and questioning at the same time. I was another very disturbing factor; she had absolutely no reason to trust me. I smiled at her, touched her hand. Her lips moved slightly in what, in different circumstances, might have become a smile.  
她说她准备好了，走到门口，却停住了，回望房间。我看到了她心理上的创伤，她极度的脆弱，未曾言说的恐惧。这个小房间是她唯一熟悉、友善的地方，外面的世界则充满了可怕的陌生感——巨大的异夜，纷飞的雪，毁灭的寒冷，威胁重重的未知未来。她的眼睛转向我，仔细搜寻着我的脸，带着沉重的怀疑与责备，既在指责也在质问。我是另一个让她极度不安的因素，她根本没有理由信任我。我对她微笑，轻轻触碰她的手。她的嘴唇微微动了动，仿佛在别的情况下可能会形成一个笑容。

We went out together into the onslaught of snow, fled through the swirling white like escaping ghosts. With no light but the snow’s faint phosphorescent gleam, it was hard to keep to the path. Even with the wind behind us, walking was hard labor. The distance to the car seemed much greater than I had thought. I held her arm to guide her and help her along. When she stumbled I put my arm round her, steadied her, held her up. Under the thick loden coat she was cold as ice, her hands felt frozen through my heavy gloves. I tried to rub some warmth into them, for a moment she leaned on me, her face a moonstone, luminous in the dark, her lashes tipped white with snow. She was tired, I sensed the effort she made to start walking again. I encouraged her, praised her, kept my arm round her waist, picked her up and carried her the last part of the way.  
我们一同走进狂风暴雪中，像逃亡的幽灵在旋转的白色世界里穿行。除了雪的微弱磷光，四周一片漆黑，几乎看不见路。即便风在我们身后，行走也依然艰难。通往车子的距离比我想象的要远得多。我搀扶着她，引导她前行。当她踉跄时，我搂住她，稳住她的身体，扶她继续前进。厚厚的呢子大衣下，她的身体冰冷如雪，她的手透过我厚重的手套依然能感受到彻骨的寒意。我试着帮她搓暖双手，片刻间她依靠在我身上，脸庞如月光石般在黑暗中发出微光，睫毛上沾满了白雪。我感觉到她的疲惫，察觉到她继续前行的努力。我鼓励她，夸奖她，始终搂着她的腰，最后抱起她，走完了最后一段路。

When we were in the car, I switched on the heater before doing anything else. The interior was warm in less than a minute, but she did not relax, sat beside me silent and tense. Catching a sidelong suspicious glance, I felt myself justly accused. After the way I had treated her, suspicion was all I deserved. She could not know that I had just discovered a new pleasure in tenderness. I asked if she was hungry; she shook her head. I produced some chocolate from the food parcel, offered it to her. No chocolate had been available for civilians for a very long time. I remembered she used to like this particular brand. She looked at it doubtfully, seemed about to refuse, then relaxed suddenly, took it, thanked me with a timid and touching smile. I wondered why I had waited so long to be kind to her, until it was almost too late. I said nothing about our ultimate fate, or about the ice-wall coming nearer and nearer. Instead, I told her the ice would stop moving before it reached the equator; that we would find a place there where we would be safe. I did not think this was remotely possible, did not know whether she believed it. However the end came, we should be together; I could at least make it quick and easy for her.  
坐进车里后，我第一件事就是打开了暖气。不到一分钟，车内就暖和起来了，但她依旧没有放松，坐在我旁边，沉默而紧张。我注意到她投来怀疑的眼神，感到自己应得此责。经过我对她的所作所为，怀疑是她唯一该有的情绪。她不可能知道，我刚刚才发现了温柔的愉悦。我问她是否饿了，她摇摇头。我从食物包裹里拿出一些巧克力递给她。很长一段时间，平民都无法获得巧克力，我记得她曾经喜欢这个牌子。她看着巧克力，犹豫片刻，似乎要拒绝，但突然放松下来，接过巧克力，带着一抹羞怯又动人的微笑向我道谢。我心想，为什么我等了这么久才对她温柔，几乎到了为时已晚的地步。

我没有提到我们最终的命运，也没有提到那逼近的冰墙。取而代之的是，我告诉她，冰墙会在到达赤道之前停下，我们会在那里找到一个安全的地方。我并不认为这有任何可能性，也不知道她是否相信。然而，无论结局如何，我们都会在一起。我至少能让她的结局变得轻松一些。

Driving the big car through the glacial night I was almost happy. I did not regret that other world I had longed for and lost. My world was now ending in snow and ice, there was nothing else left. Human life was over, the astronauts underground, buried by tons of ice, the scientists wiped out by their own disaster. I felt exhilarated because we two were alive, racing through the blizzard together.  
开着这辆大车穿过冰冷的夜晚，我几乎感到了一丝幸福。我不再为那个我曾渴望却失去的世界感到遗憾。我的世界正随着雪和冰结束，别的已经不复存在。人类的生命已走向终结，宇航员们被埋在厚厚的冰层下，科学家们被他们自己引发的灾难抹去。而我感到一种奇异的兴奋，因为我们两个人还活着，在暴风雪中一同疾驰。

It was getting more and more difficult to see out. As fast as the frost-flowers were cleared from the windscreen they reformed in more opaque patterns, until I could see nothing through them but falling snow; an infinity of snowflakes like ghostly birds, incessantly swooping past from nowhere to nowhere.  
外面的视线越来越模糊。刚刚清理掉挡风玻璃上的霜花，它们便又重新结成更不透明的图案，直到我透过它们只能看到飘落的雪花；无数的雪片如幽灵般的鸟儿，不断从虚无中飞出，又消失在虚无中。

The world seemed to have come to an end already. It did not matter. The car had become our world; a small, bright, heated room; our home in the vast, indifferent, freezing universe. To preserve the warmth generated by our bodies we kept close to each other. She no longer seemed tense or suspicious, leaning against my shoulder.  
世界仿佛已经终结。但这无关紧要。车子成了我们的世界；一个小而明亮、充满温暖的房间；在这广袤、冷漠、冰冷的宇宙中，它成了我们的家。为了维持我们身体产生的温暖，我们紧紧依偎在一起。她不再显得紧张或怀疑，靠在我的肩膀上。

A terrible cold world of ice and death had replaced the living world we had always known. Outside there was only the deadly cold, the frozen vacuum of an ice age, life reduced to mineral crystals; but here, in our lighted room, we were safe and warm. I looked into her face, it was smiling, untroubled; I could see no fear, no sadness there now. She smiled and pressed close, content with me in our home.  
一个充满冰雪与死亡的恐怖寒冷世界，已经取代了我们曾经熟悉的生机勃勃的世界。外面只有致命的寒冷，冰封时代的真空，生命被压缩成矿物晶体；但在这里，在我们光亮的房间里，我们安全而温暖。我望向她的脸，她在微笑，神情平和；此刻我看不到恐惧，也看不到悲伤。她微笑着靠近我，满足地依偎在我们的家中。

I drove at great speed, as if escaping, pretending we could escape. Although I knew there was no escape from the ice, from the ever-diminishing remnant of time that encapsuled us. I made the most of the minutes. The miles and the minutes flew past. The weight of the gun in my pocket was reassuring.  
我飞驰着，仿佛在逃离，假装我们还能逃脱。虽然我明白我们逃不出冰雪，逃不出包裹着我们的那逐渐消逝的时间残余。我尽力珍惜这些分分秒秒。时间与里程在身后飞逝。口袋里手枪的沉重感让我感到一丝安心。
