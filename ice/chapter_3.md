## THREE

Carrying my suitcase, I walked into the town. Silence obtruded itself. Nothing moved. The devastation was even greater than it had seemed from the boat. Not a building intact. Wreckage heaped in blank spaces where houses had been. Walls had crumbled; steps ascended and stopped in mid-air; arches opened on to deep craters. Little had been done to repair this wholesale destruction. Only the main streets were clear of rubble, the rest obliterated. Faint tracks, like the tracks of animals, but made by human beings, twisted among the debris. I looked in vain for somebody to direct me. The whole place seemed deserted. A train whistle at last guided me to the station, a small makeshift building constructed with materials salvaged from ruins, which reminded me of a discarded film set. Even here there was no sign of life, although presumably a train had just left. It was hard to believe the place was really in use; that anything really functioned. I was aware of an uncertainty of the real, in my surroundings and in myself. What I saw had no solidity, it was all made of mist and nylon, with nothing behind.  
提着手提箱，我走进了小镇。寂静无处不在。四周一片静谧，没有任何动静。破坏比从船上看到的更为严重。没有一栋建筑是完好的。废墟堆积在曾是房屋的空地上。墙壁坍塌了；楼梯在半空中戛然而止；拱门通向深深的弹坑。这片大规模的毁灭几乎没有得到任何修复。只有主干道上没有瓦砾，其他地方全被掩埋了。淡淡的小径，如同动物的踪迹，却是人类留下的，在废墟间蜿蜒。我无望地寻找着能够指引我的人。这地方仿佛被遗弃了一般。最后，火车的汽笛声引导我找到了车站，那是一个用从废墟中抢救出来的材料搭建的小小临时建筑，令我想起了被遗弃的电影布景。即便在这里，也没有生命的迹象，尽管大概刚刚有一列火车离开。很难相信这个地方真的在使用；有什么是真正运作的。我意识到周围环境和我自身的现实感都充满了不确定性。我所看到的一切没有实体，仿佛是由雾气和尼龙组成的，背后什么也没有。

I went on to the platform. They must have dynamited some of the ruins to lay the track. I could see the single line running out of the town, crossing a strip of open ground before it entered the fir forest. This fragile link with the world did not inspire confidence. I had the feeling it stopped just beyond the first trees. The mountains rose close behind. I shouted, “Is anyone here?” A man appeared from somewhere, made a threatening gesture. “You’re trespassing—get out!” I explained that I had just come off the boat and wanted to find a room. He stared, hostile, suspicious, uncouth, saying nothing. I asked the way to the main street. In a sulky voice I could hardly understand he muttered a few words, staring at me the whole time as if I had dropped from Mars.  
我走到了站台上。他们一定是炸毁了一些废墟来铺设铁轨。我可以看到那条单线铁路从城里延伸出去，穿过一片空地，然后进入了松林。这条脆弱的与外界连接的纽带并没有带给我信心。我感觉它在第一棵树后就戛然而止了。山脉在近处耸立。我喊道，“这里有人吗？”从某个地方出现了一个人，做出威胁的手势。“你擅自闯入了——出去！”我解释说我刚下船，想找个房间。他盯着我看，目光中充满敌意、怀疑和粗鲁，一言不发。我问去主街的路。他用一种我几乎听不懂的生气语调嘟囔了几句，整个过程都盯着我看，好像我从火星掉下来的一样。

I walked on with my bag, came to an open square where people were going about. The men’s black tunics were variations of those I had already seen, and most of the wearers carried knives or guns. The women also wore black, producing a gloomy effect. All the faces were blank and unsmiling. For the first time I saw signs that some buildings were occupied, a few even had glass in the windows. There were market stalls and small shops: wooden huts and lean-tos had been tacked on to some of the patched-up ruins. A café was open at the end of the square, and there was a cinema, shut, displaying a tattered advertisement of a year-old program. This evidently was the living heart of the town; the rest was just the remains of the dead past.  
我提着行李继续走，来到一个人们来来往往的开阔广场。男人们穿的黑色上衣虽然样式各异，却都与我之前见过的相似，而且大多数人都带着刀或枪。女人们也穿着黑色衣物，显得十分阴郁。所有的面孔都空洞无表情，毫无笑意。第一次我看到了一些有人居住的迹象，甚至有几扇窗户上还装着玻璃。广场上有市场摊位和小商店：一些木头棚屋和简易搭建物紧贴在修补过的废墟上。一家咖啡馆在广场尽头开着，还有一家电影院关着门，展示着一张破烂的、过时一年的广告。这显然是小镇的生活中心；其余的地方只是死去过去的遗迹。

I invited the proprietor of the café to drink with me, hoping to establish good relations before I asked for a room. All these people seemed insular and suspicious, antagonistic to strangers. We drank the local brandy made out of plums, potent and fiery, a good drink for a cold climate. He was a big, robust man, better than a peasant. At first I could hardly get a word out of him, but over the second glass he relaxed enough to ask why I had come. “Nobody ever comes here; we have nothing to attract foreigners—only ruins.” I said: “The ruins of your town are famous. They’re the reason for my coming. I’m making a study of them for a learned society.” I had decided beforehand to say this. “You mean people in other countries are interested?” “Certainly. This town is a place of historic importance.” He was flattered, as I expected. “That’s true. We have a glorious war record.” “And also a record of discovery. Did you know that a map has been found recently which indicates that your long boats crossed the Atlantic and were the first to reach the new world?” “You expect to find proof of this in the ruins?” It had not occurred to me, but I assented. “I know of course that I must get permits: everything must be done correctly. Unfortunately I don’t know who’s the right man to approach.” Without hesitation he said: “You must ask the warden. He controls everything.” Here was an unexpected stroke of luck. “How do I get in touch with him?” I had a vision of an iron hand gripping a girl’s thin wrist, crushing the brittle prominent bones. “That’s simple. You make an appointment through one of the secretaries at the High House.” I was delighted by such good fortune. I had been prepared to wait and scheme for a chance of seeing this man; now the opportunity had presented itself at the very beginning.  
我邀请咖啡馆的老板一起喝酒，希望在询问住宿前先建立好关系。这些人看起来都封闭而多疑，对陌生人抱有敌意。我们喝着用李子酿制的当地白兰地，强劲火辣，是冷天气下的好酒。他是个强壮魁梧的男人，比普通农民更胜一筹。起初我几乎无法从他嘴里套出一个字，但喝完第二杯酒后，他放松下来，问我为什么来这里。“从来没有人来这里，我们没有什么吸引外国人的东西——只有废墟。”我说：“你们城镇的废墟很有名。这是我来这里的原因。我在为一个学术机构研究它们。”我事先决定了要这么说。“你是说其他国家的人对此感兴趣？”“当然。这座城镇具有历史重要性。”正如我所料，他感到受宠若惊。“确实如此。我们有着光辉的战争记录。”“还有发现的记录。你知道最近发现了一张地图，显示你们的长船曾经穿越大西洋，成为第一个到达新大陆的队伍吗？”“你希望在废墟中找到这个的证据？”我没有想过这一点，但我点了头。“当然，我知道必须获得许可：一切都必须按照规定进行。不幸的是，我不知道该找谁。”他毫不犹豫地说：“你得找看守。他掌控一切。”这真是个意外的好运气。“我怎么联系他？”我脑海中浮现出一个铁手紧握女孩纤细手腕，压碎脆弱突出骨头的画面。“很简单，你可以通过高宅的秘书们预约。”我为这意外的好运感到欣喜。我原本准备等待和策划才能有机会见到这个人，现在机会在一开始就出现了。

The business of the room was also settled without difficulty. I was having a run of good luck. Although the proprietor could not accommodate me himself, his sister who lived nearby had a spare room I could rent. “She’s a widow and can do with the extra money, you understand.” He went off to telephone to her; returned after rather a long absence, saying that it was all arranged. He would provide my two main meals at the café; breakfast would be brought to my room. “You won’t be disturbed there while you’re working, it’s very quiet. The house looks away from the street, faces the water; and nobody ever goes there.” His cooperation was valuable, so to keep the conversation going I asked why people avoided the vicinity of the fjord. “Because they’re afraid of the dragon that lives at the bottom.” I looked at him, thought he was joking; but his face was perfectly serious, his voice had been matter-of-fact. I had never before met anyone who owned a telephone and believed in dragons. It amused me, and also contributed to my sense of the unreal.  
房间的事也很顺利地解决了，我的运气似乎很好。虽然店主自己无法提供住宿，但他住在附近的妹妹有一间空房可以租给我。“她是个寡妇，需要一些额外的收入，你明白的。”他说完就去给她打电话，过了很长一段时间才回来，说一切都安排好了。他会在咖啡馆提供我两顿主要的饭菜，早餐则会送到我房间。“在那里你不会被打扰，非常安静。那房子背对街道，面向水边；从来没有人去那里。”他的合作非常宝贵，为了继续话题，我问为什么人们避开峡湾附近的地方。“因为他们害怕住在水底的龙。”我看着他，以为他在开玩笑；但他表情非常严肃，语气也很平静。我从未遇到过既有电话又相信龙的人。这让我感到好笑，也加深了我对这种不真实感的体会。

The room proved to be dark and devoid of comfort or convenience. It was not warm enough. However, it had a bed, a table and chair—the basic necessities. I was lucky to get it as no other accommodation was available. The sister looked older and much less sophisticated than her brother, who must have persuaded her to take me in against her will during their long talk on the telephone. She was evidently reluctant to admit a foreigner to the house where she lived alone; I could feel her suspicious dislike. To avoid trouble I paid the exorbitant price she asked without question, a week in advance.  
房间果然阴暗，缺乏舒适和便利设施。室内也不够温暖。不过，这里有张床、一张桌子和一把椅子——基本的生活必需品。因为没有其他住宿选择，我能租到这个房间已经算幸运了。妹妹看起来比她哥哥要年长很多，也远没有他那样精明干练。显然，她哥哥在电话中和她长谈时，一定是劝说她违背自己的意愿收留了我。她显然不愿意让一个外国人住进她独居的房子；我能感受到她对我那种带着怀疑的厌恶。为了避免麻烦，我没有提出任何异议，提前一周支付了她那高得离谱的要价。

I asked for the keys, saying I would have a duplicate cut for the outer door: I had to be independent. She brought the two keys, but gave me only the key of my own door, hiding the other one in the palm of her hand. I told her to hand it over. She refused. I insisted. She became stubborn and retreated into the kitchen. I followed and took the key from her forcibly. I did not much care for this sort of behavior, but a principle was involved. She would not oppose me again.  
我向她要了钥匙，并说我要为外门钥匙配一把副本：我需要独立。她拿来了两把钥匙，但只给了我自己的房门钥匙，另一把藏在手心里。我让她把那把钥匙交出来，她拒绝了。我坚持要求，她变得固执起来，并退回到厨房。我跟了过去，强行从她手中夺过了钥匙。虽然我不喜欢这种行为，但涉及到一个原则问题。她以后不会再反对我了。

I went out and walked about, exploring the town: the empty lanes silent between shapeless shapes of decay, the ruined forts jutting into the greengage sea, the huge slab-steps of a giant’s staircase where the great wall had fallen, subsiding in solid sections. Everywhere the ubiquitous ruins, decayed fortifications, evidences of a warlike bloodthirsty past. I searched for buildings of a more recent date. There were none. The dwindling population lived like rats in the ruins of a lost martial supremacy. If one place became uninhabitable its occupants moved to another. The community was gradually dying out, each year its numbers declined. There were enough disintegrating structures to last them out. At first it was hard to distinguish the inhabited buildings; I learned to look for the signs of occupation, the reinforced door, the boarded-up windows.  
我走出门，四处闲逛，探索着这个小镇：空荡荡的小巷在无形无状的废墟之间寂静无声，破败的堡垒突兀地伸向青褐色的大海，巨大的台阶如同巨人的阶梯，曾经的高墙已经倒塌，化作一块块沉重的残片。到处都是普遍存在的废墟，破败的防御工事，战争嗜血过去的证据。我试图寻找一些年代较近的建筑，却没有找到。渐渐减少的人口就像老鼠一样生活在失去军事霸权的废墟中。如果一个地方变得无法居住，其居民就会搬到另一个地方。这个社区正在逐渐消亡，每年人口都在减少。足够多的坍塌结构足以维持他们最后的岁月。起初，很难区分那些有人居住的建筑；后来我学会了寻找居住的迹象，比如加固的门和封闭的窗户。

I made an appointment to see the warden at the High House, which dominated the town, a fortress-like mass built at its highest point. At the time agreed, I climbed a steep road, the only one that led to it. From the outside the place looked like an armed fort, enormously massive, thick walls, no windows, some narrow slits high up that might have been meant for machine guns. Batteries flanked the entrance, apparently trained on the road. I assumed they were relics of some old campaign, although they did not look especially obsolete. I had spoken to a secretary on the telephone; but now I was met by four armed guards in black tunics, who escorted me down a long corridor, two walking in front, two behind. It was dark. High above, thin pencils of daylight, entering through the slits in the outer wall, dimly revealed glimpses of other corridors, galleries, stairs, bridge-like landings, at different levels, radiating in different directions. The invisible ceiling must have been enormously high, the full height of the building, for all these indistinct ramifications were far overhead. Something moved at the end of one vista: a girl’s figure. I rushed after her as she started to climb some stairs, her silvery hair lifting, glimmering in the darkness, at every step.  
我预约了去高宅拜见看守人。高宅位于小镇的制高点，俯瞰整个小镇，如同一座堡垒般的巨大建筑。在约定的时间，我沿着唯一通向高宅的陡峭小路攀登。从外面看，这地方像个武装堡垒，墙体极为厚实，没有窗户，只有一些高处的窄缝，可能是为机枪设计的。电池阵列两侧是入口，似乎对准了道路。我猜测这些都是某次旧战役的遗迹，虽然它们看上去并不算特别陈旧。我在电话中与一位秘书交谈过；但现在，我被四名穿黑色上衣的武装警卫迎接，他们沿着一条长长的走廊护送我，前面两人，后面两人。这里一片昏暗。高高的上方，微弱的光线像铅笔一样细细地透过外墙的窄缝射入，隐约照亮了其他走廊、画廊、楼梯、桥状的着陆点，它们分布在不同的楼层，向不同的方向延伸。看不见的天花板一定非常高，足以容纳整个建筑的高度，因为这些模糊的分支都在远处高高的头顶上。我在其中一个长廊的尽头看到有东西在动：是一个女孩的身影。我立刻追了过去，她开始攀登一些台阶，银白色的头发在每一步中都在黑暗中闪烁，轻轻扬起。

The short steep stair led to one room only, large, sparsely furnished, its polished floor bare like a dance floor. I was immediately struck by the unnatural silence, a curious hushed quality in the air, which reduced her movements to mouse-like scratchings. Not a sound penetrated from outside or from other parts of the building. I was puzzled, until it dawned on me that the room had been soundproofed, so that whatever took place there would be inaudible beyond its four walls. Then it at once became obvious why this particular room had been allotted to her.  
那段陡峭的短梯只通向一个房间，房间很大，布置简陋，光滑的地板像是舞池一样光秃秃的。我立刻被这里的不自然的寂静所吸引，空气中有一种奇异的压抑感，使得她的动作变得像老鼠般轻微的划动声。从外面或建筑的其他部分没有一丝声音渗入。我感到困惑，直到我意识到这个房间是经过隔音处理的，这样无论这里发生什么，都不会传出房间四壁。然后，这个房间为什么特别被分配给她的原因也就显而易见了。

She was in bed, not asleep, waiting. A faint pinkish glow came from a lamp beside her. The wide bed stood on a platform, bed and platform alike covered in sheepskin, facing a great mirror nearly as long as the wall. Alone here, where nobody could hear her, where nobody was meant to hear, she was cut off from all contact, totally vulnerable, at the mercy of the man who came in without knocking, without a word, his cold, very bright blue eyes pouncing on hers in the glass. She crouched motionless, staring silently into the mirror, as if mesmerized. The hypnotic power of his eyes could destroy her will, already weakened by the mother who for years had persistently crushed it into submission. Forced since childhood into a victim’s pattern of thought and behavior, she was defenseless against his aggressive will, which was able to take complete possession of her. I saw it happen.  
她躺在床上，没有睡，等待着。床头灯发出微弱的粉红色光芒。宽大的床铺在一个平台上，床和平台都覆盖着羊毛皮，正对着一面几乎和墙一样长的大镜子。在这里，她独自一人，无人能听见她，甚至没有人会去听见她，她被完全切断了所有的联系，毫无防备地任由那个不敲门、不说话进来的男人摆布。他冰冷、明亮的蓝眼睛在镜子中猛然盯住她。她蜷缩着一动不动，默默地盯着镜子，仿佛被催眠了。他那催眠般的眼神可以摧毁她的意志，那意志早已被她母亲多年持续的压制驯服。自幼被迫接受受害者的思维模式和行为习惯，她无力抵抗这个男人咄咄逼人的意志，而这个意志能够完全占有她。我目睹了这一切的发生。

He approached the bed with unhurried steps. She did not move until he bent over her, when she twisted away abruptly, as if trying to escape, buried her face in the pillow. His hand reached out, slid over her shoulder, strong fingers feeling along her jawbone, gripping, tilting, forcing her head up. She resisted violently, in sudden terror, twisting and turning wildly, struggling against his strength. He did nothing at all, let her go on fighting. Her feeble struggles amused him, he knew they would not last long. He looked on in silence, in half-smiling amusement, always tilting her face with slight but inescapable pressure, while she exhausted herself.  
他不慌不忙地走近床边。直到他弯下身，她才突然扭过头，好像试图逃跑一样，把脸埋进了枕头。他的手伸出，滑过她的肩膀，强有力的手指沿着她的下颌骨摸索，紧紧抓住，强迫她抬起头来。她恐惧地剧烈反抗，疯狂地扭动和挣扎，对抗着他的力量。他什么也没做，只是任由她继续挣扎。她那无力的挣扎令他感到有趣，他知道这不会持续太久。他静静地看着，带着半笑的表情，似乎在嘲弄她。每次她用力挣扎时，他都会用轻微却无法逃脱的力量扭她的脸，直到她精疲力竭。

Suddenly she gave in, worn out, beaten; she was panting, her face was wet. He tightened his grip slightly, compelled her to look straight at him. To bring the thing to a finish, he stared into her dilated eyes, implacably forced into them his own arrogant, ice-blue gaze. This was the moment of her surrender; opposition collapsed at this point, when she seemed to fall and drown in those cold blue mesmeric depths. Now she had no more will. He could do what he liked with her.  
突然间，她屈服了，筋疲力尽，败下阵来。她喘着粗气，脸上满是泪水。他稍微加紧了手中的力度，迫使她直视自己。为了结束这场对抗，他直视她瞪大的眼睛，毫不动摇地用自己那傲慢、冰冷的蓝色眼神逼迫她。就在这一刻，她彻底屈服了，反抗在这时崩溃了，她仿佛在那冰冷的蓝色迷人深处坠落、溺毙。现在她已经没有任何意志，他可以随心所欲地对她为所欲为。

He leaned further, knelt on the bed, pushed her down with his hands on her shoulders. Will-less, she submitted to him, even to the extent of making small compliant movements fitting her body to his. She was dazed, she hardly knew what was happening, her normal state of consciousness interrupted, lost, the nature of her surrender not understood. He was intent only on his enjoyment.  
他俯下身，更靠近她，跪在床上，用双手压住她的肩膀，将她按倒。失去了意志的她顺从了他，甚至做出一些顺从的小动作，让自己的身体贴合他的身体。她昏昏沉沉，几乎不明白发生了什么，她的正常意识被打断、迷失，对自己屈服的性质一无所知。他只专注于自己的享受。

Later she did not move, gave no indication of life, lying exposed on the ruined bed as on a slab in a mortuary. Sheets and blankets spilled on to the floor, trailed over the edge of the dais. Her head hung over the edge of the bed in a slightly unnatural position, the neck slightly twisted in a way that suggested violence, the bright hair twisted into a sort of rope by his hands. He sat with his hand upon her, asserting his right to his prey. When his fingers passed over her naked body, lingering on thighs and breasts, she was shaken by a long painful shudder; then she went still again.  
之后，她一动不动，仿佛失去了生气，裸露地躺在破败的床上，像停尸房里的石板上一样。床单和毯子洒落在地上，拖到台座的边缘。她的头垂在床边，略显不自然的姿势，颈部微微扭曲，仿佛经历了暴力，她那明亮的头发被他的手拧成了一条绳索。他坐在床边，把手放在她身上，宣示着他对猎物的占有权。当他的手指划过她裸露的身体，在大腿和胸部徘徊时，她被一阵痛苦的长时间颤抖所震撼；然后，她再次变得僵硬。

He lifted her head with one hand, looked into her face for a moment, let the head fall back on the pillow; it lay as it fell. He stood up, moved away from the bed; his foot caught in the fold of a blanket, he kicked it back and went on to the door. He had not spoken a single word since he entered the room, and he left it without a sound, apart from the faint click of the closing door. To her, this silence was one of the most terrifying things about him, in some way associated with his power over her.  
他用一只手抬起她的头，凝视了一会儿她的脸，然后让头掉回到枕头上；头就那样落下，躺着。他站起来，离开了床，脚踢到了床单的褶皱，他踢回去后继续朝门走去。他自进门以来没有说过一句话，离开时也未发一言，只有轻微的门锁扣上的声音。对她来说，这份沉默是他身上最可怕的东西之一，某种程度上与他对她的掌控力联系在一起。

I wondered where I was being taken. The place was colossal, the passages wound on and on. We passed the trap doors of oubliettes, cells hacked out of the rock. The walls of these hutches were running with water, with some noisome exudation. Perilous steps led down to still deeper dungeons. We went through several pairs of huge doors, which the guards in front unlocked and the others slammed shut behind us.  
我不禁好奇我们被带到了哪里。这个地方宏伟壮观，走廊蜿蜒曲折，仿佛没有尽头。我们经过了隐蔽的暗门，通向那些被凿刻在岩石中的牢房。牢房墙壁上不断有水流淌，渗出一些恶臭的液体。危险的台阶通向更深的地下监牢。我们穿过了几对巨大的门，前面的卫兵解锁，后面的卫兵随后将门重重关上。

The warden received me in a civilized room. It was spacious and well-proportioned, the wood floor reflecting dim old chandeliers. The windows faced away from the town, over park-like grounds, sloping down to the distant fjord. His perfectly fitting black tunic was of superb material, his high boots shone like mirrors. He was wearing the colored ribbon of some order I did not know. This time my impression was more favorable; the arrogant look I disliked was less in evidence, although it was clear that he was a born ruler, a law unto himself, not to be judged by the usual standards. “What can I do for you?” He greeted me with formal politeness, his blue eyes looked me straight in the face. I told him the story I had prepared. He agreed at once to have the necessary permits made out and signed, I would get them tomorrow. On his own initiative he suggested adding a note to the effect that I was to be given help in my investigations. To me it seemed superfluous. He said: “You don’t know these people. They are naturally lawless and have an innate dislike of strangers, their ways are violent and archaic. I’ve tried hard to introduce more modern attitudes. But it’s useless, they’re embedded in the past like Lot’s wife in her pillar of salt; you can’t detach them from it.” I thanked him; at the same time I was thinking about the guards, who hardly seemed to fit in with his enlightened outlook.  
典狱长在一个文明化的房间里接待了我。房间宽敞、比例匀称，木地板反射着昏暗的古老吊灯。窗户面向城外，俯瞰着公园般的场地，延伸到远处的峡湾。他穿着一件完美贴身的黑色军装，质地上乘，光亮的高筒靴如镜子般闪耀，胸前佩戴着我不认识的某种勋章。这次给我的印象更好，那令我反感的傲慢神情少了些，尽管明显看出他是个天生的统治者，独断专行，无法用通常的标准来评判他。“我能为您做些什么？”他以礼貌的形式性问候我，蓝眼睛直视着我的脸。我向他讲述了我准备好的故事。他立刻同意办理和签署必要的许可证，明天就会拿到。他主动建议添加一条说明，表示会给予我调查方面的帮助。在我看来这似乎有些多余。他说：“你不了解这些人。他们天性不守法，天生对外人有种反感，他们的方式既暴力又古老。我努力想引入更现代的态度，但无济于事，他们像罗得的妻子一样深嵌在过去的盐柱中，无法将他们从中剥离。”我向他表示感谢，同时我心里想着那些卫兵，他们似乎并不符合他的开明态度。

He remarked that I had chosen a strange time for my visit. I asked why. “The ice will be here very soon. The harbor will freeze, we shall be cut off.” He flashed a blue glance at me. Something had not been said. He had a trick of blinking his very bright eyes, which then seemed to emit blue flames. He went on: “You may be stranded here longer than you bargained for.” Again the sharp look, as if something more were implied. I told him: “I’m only staying for a week or so. I don’t expect to find anything new. It’s more a matter of getting the atmosphere.” In spite of my original aversion, I suddenly had a curious sense of contact with him, almost as though some personal link existed between us. The feeling was so unexpected, unaccountable and confusing that I added, “Please don’t misunderstand me,” without knowing quite what I meant. He seemed gratified, smiled, and at once became more friendly. “So we speak the same language. Good. I’m glad you’ve come. We need closer contact in this country with the sophisticated nations. This is a beginning.” Still somewhat hazy as to what we were talking about, I stood up to go, thanking him again. He shook my hand. “You must come and dine one evening. Let me know in the meantime if I can be of any further service to you.”  
他提到我选择了一个奇怪的时间来访问。我问为什么。他说：“冰很快就会来了。港口会结冰，我们将被切断。”他闪了一下蓝色的眼神，似乎有什么未曾言明。他有一个眨眼的习惯，那双非常明亮的眼睛仿佛能发出蓝色的火焰。他继续说道：“你可能会被困在这里，比你预想的时间更长。”又是锐利的一瞥，仿佛话里有话。我告诉他：“我只打算待上一周左右。我不指望发现什么新东西，更多的是为了感受这里的氛围。”尽管我最初对他有种反感，但突然间我感到一种奇怪的接触感，几乎好像我们之间存在某种个人联系。这种感觉如此出乎意料，难以解释并且令人困惑，以至于我补充道：“请别误会我，”但我自己也不清楚这话是什么意思。他似乎很满意，微笑着，立刻变得更友好。“看来我们讲的是同一种语言。很好。我很高兴你来了。我们需要与更先进的国家有更密切的联系。这只是个开始。”仍然有些模糊不清我们在谈什么的我，站起来告辞，再次感谢他。他握了握我的手说：“你必须找个晚上来共进晚餐。如果我还能为你效劳，请随时告知。”

I was jubilant. My luck was holding. I seemed almost to have attained my object already, I was sure of a chance of seeing the girl. If the dinner invitation failed to materialize, I could always fall back on his final offer.  
我欣喜若狂，觉得自己运气正旺。似乎我几乎已经达成了目的，我确信会有机会见到那个女孩。如果晚宴邀请没有实现，我总是可以依靠他最后的承诺。
