## FOURTEEN

My head was aching, everything was confused inside it. I knew only that I had to get out of the town before daylight. I could not think. The hallucination of one moment did not fit the reality of the next. In a narrow alley, a car came tearing toward me to run me down, filling the whole space between alp-high houses. With bleeding knuckles I staggered from door to locked door, at the last moment crushed myself up against one. In uniform, immensely grand, the warden drove past in his great black car. The girl was with him, her hair shimmering violet like the shadows of trees on snow. They drove through the snow together under a white fur rug, wide as a room, deep as a snowdrift, edged with cabochon rubies.  
我的头剧痛，思绪一片混乱。我只知道必须在天亮前离开这座城镇，无法集中思考。前一刻的幻觉与下一刻的现实完全不符。在一条狭窄的小巷里，一辆车呼啸而来，似乎要把我碾压，挤满了两旁如阿尔卑斯山般高耸的房屋之间的空隙。我带着流血的指关节，踉跄地从一扇锁着的门走向另一扇门，最后一刻将自己紧贴在一扇门上。身穿华贵制服的典狱长开着他的黑色大车从我身旁驶过，女孩和他在一起，头发在雪地的树影中泛着紫罗兰色的光辉。他们裹着一条如房间般宽广的白色皮毯，厚如雪堆，边缘镶嵌着凸圆红宝石，一起穿越雪原。

Lit by the dazzling cold fire of the aurora borealis, they walked among glittering icebergs; a blizzard blew arctic white, his bone-white forehead and icicle eyes, her silver-frosted hair bright with ice flowers under the pole star. A thunderclap boomed in the ice. He fought a polar bear, strangled it with his hands, to train her in toughness taught her to take the skin with his wicked knife. When it was done, she crept close for warmth. The huge skin covered them both, its long white hairs tipped with blood. The snowy thickness hid their two bodies; blood dripping from the tips of the dense fur turned the snow blood-red.  
在极光冰冷耀眼的光芒下，他们走在闪闪发光的冰山之间；暴风雪卷着北极的纯白，映照出他骨白的额头和冰冷的眼睛，她的银发上凝结着冰花，在北极星下闪闪发光。冰层中传来一声雷鸣。他与一头北极熊搏斗，用双手将其勒死，为了锻炼她的坚韧，他用锋利的匕首教她如何剥下熊皮。当一切结束后，她紧贴他以取暖。巨大的熊皮将他们两人覆盖，长长的白毛尖端染上了血。厚厚的雪皮掩盖了他们的身体，血从浓密的皮毛尖滴落，将雪染成了血红色。

I saw her standing in torchlight with dreaming eyes. I watched her, wanted her, wanted to take her away with me. But that other had claimed her; her white girl’s body fell through the smoke of smoldering torches across his knees. I was out searching for her, marauders were sacking the town. I searched everywhere, could not find her, stumbled over her in the rubble, her head awry. Through the smoke and dust filling the air, I saw her skin white against dirt and debris, the blood first red and then black on the white, her head twisted sideways by the unbelievable hair, the slender neck broken. Victimization in childhood had made her accept the fate of a victim, and whatever I did or did not do this fate would ultimately achieve itself. To leave her to it was one thing. To leave her to that man was quite a different thing. It was something I could not do.  
我看见她站在火把的光下，双眼迷离如梦。我凝视她，渴望她，想把她带走。但另一个人已宣示了她的归属，她那白皙的少女身躯从烟雾缭绕的火把间落在他的膝上。我四处寻找她，劫掠者正在掠夺这座城。我到处搜寻，却始终找不到她，最后在瓦砾中跌倒，无意间发现了她的身影，她的头歪向一边。烟尘弥漫的空气中，我看见她的皮肤在污垢和碎片中显得苍白无比，血从鲜红变成黑色，浸染在白皙的皮肤上，她的头被那不可思议的长发扭曲，纤细的脖子已经断裂。童年时的受害经历使她接受了命运的牺牲，不论我做什么或不做什么，这种命运终将降临。任由她走向这样的结局是一回事，但将她交给那个男人是完全不同的事。这是我绝不能做到的。

I had to get to her before he did. But the difficulties were overwhelming. The total absence of transport meant resorting to bribery, every kind of deception, worse. In my mind’s eye I kept seeing the iceline moving across the ocean, toward the islands, toward that particular island I had not identified on the map. I thought of her at the center, not knowing she was encircled, while we advanced toward her from different sides, I from one point, he from another, and then the ice . . . My chances of arriving first seemed almost non-existent. Every mile would be slow and difficult for me. He could get to her by plane in just a few hours, whenever he felt inclined. I could only hope for the important conference he was now attending and other military matters to detain him as long as possible. But I was not optimistic.  
我必须在他之前赶到她那里。但困难重重。完全没有交通工具，只能依靠贿赂、各种欺骗，甚至更糟的手段。脑海中不断浮现出冰线横跨海洋，向着岛屿推进，向着那张地图上我未曾确认的岛屿。我想着她，身处中心，不知道自己已被包围，而我们从不同的方向接近她，我从一个点，他从另一个点，而冰……我几乎没有任何希望能先到她那里。每一英里对我来说都将艰难而缓慢。而他可以随时乘飞机在几个小时内到达，只要他愿意。我只能希望他现在参加的重要会议和其他军事事务能尽量拖延他的时间，但我并不乐观。

My head wound and slashed face had begun to heal normally, but I did not feel normal. My head ached all the time, I was pursued by horrific visions, disasters exploding in violent death, universal destruction. I was always aware that I was going to execution. Not that my own death seemed to matter. I had lived, I had done things, I had seen the world. I did not want to grow old, deteriorate, lose my intelligence and my physical faculties. But I had this compulsive urge to see the girl once more; to be the first to reach her.  
我的头伤和脸上的伤口虽然正在正常愈合，但我并不觉得自己正常。头痛始终折磨着我，恐怖的幻象不断追赶着我，灾难在剧烈的死亡中爆发，仿佛整个世界都在毁灭。我始终清楚，我正走向处决。并不是说我在乎自己的死亡，我已经活过了，做过一些事，见识过这个世界。我不想变老，不想衰退，不想失去我的智慧和身体的机能。然而，我却有一种不可遏制的冲动，想要再见她一面，想成为第一个到达她身边的人。

I had to travel an enormous distance. Because I could not risk crossing the frontier openly, for two days I went on foot through wild country, without shelter, without food or drink. Later I had the luck to be taken some of the way by helicopter. A naked woman, life-size, was painted on the side in crude colors; pop art in the midst of war. A person in occupation had to be disposed of; I was not going to lose the chance of a lift. The luck did not last. In a frenzy I searched the wreckage for the man who had been shot down. Only the painted face simpered at me among the debris, round pink circles for cheeks, black eyes blankly serene as a painted doll’s.  
我必须穿越极其遥远的距离。因为不能冒险公开越境，我在荒野中徒步走了两天，没有庇护，没有食物和水。后来，幸运的是，一架直升机捎了我一程。直升机一侧画着一个裸女，色彩粗陋，战争中的波普艺术。一个占据者必须被清除，我不会错过搭乘的机会。但这份好运并没有持续太久。在疯狂中，我在残骸中搜寻被击落的飞行员。只有那个画上的脸在废墟中对我做着傻笑，圆圆的粉色脸颊，黑色的眼睛像个漠然的洋娃娃。

In a country at war I tried to keep away from the fighting, came to a town unexpectedly quiet, except for the lorries that thundered through, crammed with troops or workers. A dull gray day and a dull gray town, sickly women languidly slapping their dirty washing on flat river stones. I was worn out and started to lose heart. Without some form of transport I would never complete my journey. I saw nothing encouraging here. Passers-by averted their eyes when I looked at them; they were suspicious of strangers, and with my scarred face, my old torn muddy guerrilla’s outfit, my appearance could not have been reassuring. I went about searching for someone who looked approachable, found no such person. I talked to the owner of a garage, offered him money, a new foreign rifle with telescopic sights; he threatened to call the police, would do nothing to help me.  
在一个战乱中的国家，我尽量远离战斗，来到了一个出奇安静的小镇，除了运载着士兵或工人的卡车隆隆驶过。灰蒙蒙的一天，灰蒙蒙的城镇，病态的妇女无力地把脏衣服拍在平坦的河石上。我筋疲力尽，开始灰心丧气。没有交通工具，我永远无法完成这趟旅程。这里没有任何鼓舞人心的景象。路人避开了我的目光；他们对陌生人充满怀疑，而我满脸伤痕，身穿破旧泥泞的游击队服装，外表自然不会让人放心。我到处寻找看起来和善的人，却毫无收获。我与一家车库的老板交谈，提出给他钱，或一支带瞄准镜的外国新式步枪；他威胁要报警，拒绝为我提供任何帮助。

At dusk it began to rain, rained harder as night came on. A curfew was in force: no light showed from the houses, the streets were empty. I was taking a risk by staying outside, but was too despondent to care. A siren howled, distant crashes, gradually coming nearer, followed at intervals, alternating with bursts of gunfire. Rain fell in sheets, the street had become a river. I sheltered under an archway, shivered, could not think what to do; my brain seemed paralyzed by discomfort. I felt desperate, in despair.  
黄昏时分开始下雨，夜幕降临后雨势加剧。宵禁已经开始，房屋内没有一丝灯光，街道空无一人。我冒着风险留在外面，但沮丧得已不在乎。一声警报尖叫响起，远处的爆炸声逐渐逼近，伴随着间歇的枪声爆发。雨如注倾泻，街道变成了一条河。我躲在一座拱门下，浑身发抖，脑袋一片空白，想不出该做什么；仿佛不适感让我的思维完全瘫痪。我感到绝望，陷入深深的无助之中。

A big military car swished past, stopped on the opposite side of the road. Impregnable in steel helmet, overcoat and high boots, the driver got out and went into a house. The desultory bombardment was still going on. There was no need for silence. In desperation, I prized up one of the granite cobbles, hurled it through a ground-floor window, put my hand in, pushed up the glass, swung myself over the sill. Before my feet touched the floor, the door of the room opened, I faced the man from the car. A sudden much louder explosion rocked everything, filled the dark room with a fiery blaze, reflected on cheekbones, eyeballs. Blood gushed from the wound, ran in dark rivers I tried to check, while I dragged off his uniform, put it on, forced him into my tattered clothes. By good luck we were about the same size. I went round hurriedly, wrecking the room, threw the furniture about, smashed mirrors, opened drawers, ripped pictures with my knife, to make it look as if a looter had broken in and been shot by the householder. I could not stand the weight of the metal helmet on my head. Carrying it in my hand, I went out, dressed as the other man, got into the armored car, drove away. I had not succeeded in keeping his blood off the uniform, but with the fur-lined coat fastened the stains did not show.  
一辆军车疾驰而过，在路对面停下。司机戴着钢盔，穿着厚重的军大衣和高筒靴，从车里出来，走进了一栋房子。零星的炮击仍在继续，没有任何需要保持安静的理由。绝望之中，我撬起一块花岗岩石块，砸破一楼的窗户，把手伸进去推开玻璃，翻过窗台。还没等双脚落地，房门突然打开，我正面遇上了从车里出来的男人。突然，一声巨响震撼一切，火光瞬间照亮黑暗的房间，映在他的颧骨和眼球上。我赶紧止住从伤口涌出的鲜血，血液如黑河般淌下。我迅速扒下他的制服，套在自己身上，把他塞进我破旧的衣服里。幸运的是，我们的身形差不多。我急忙环顾四周，弄乱房间，掀翻家具，打碎镜子，翻开抽屉，用刀划破画作，伪装成一个被屋主击毙的抢劫犯。我头上受不了钢盔的重量，索性提在手里，穿着那人的衣服走出去，坐进装甲车，驾车驶离。尽管没能完全挡住制服上的血迹，但把毛皮大衣扣紧后，血渍就不明显了。

I was stopped at a checkpoint on the outskirts. A bomb obligingly dropped near by. There was chaos, the guards had no time to interrogate me. I bluffed my way through and drove on. I knew I had not satisfied them, that they suspected something; but I thought they were too busy to worry about me. I was wrong. I had only gone a few miles when searchlights spotlit the car, I heard the roar of supercharged motorcycles behind me. One rider hurtled past, ordering me to stop. Just ahead, he braked hard, stayed straddled in the middle of the road, suicidal, his gun pointed at me, spitting bullets which bounced off like hailstones. I put on speed, hit him squarely, glanced back, saw a black shape fly over handlebars and another crash down, as the next two machines skidded into the wreck and piled up. The shooting went on for a bit, but no one came after me. I hoped the survivors would stay to clean up the mess and give me time to get right away. The rain stopped, warlike noises died out, I began to relax. Then my headlights caught figures in uniform hurrying off the road, patrol cars blocking it, parked right across. Somebody must have telephoned on ahead. I wondered why they thought me important enough to send out all these people; decided they must already have found the man who should have been driving, and that the importance was his. They started firing. I accelerated, vaguely recalling the warden’s story of crashing a frontier barrier, as the car burst through the obstruction like tissue paper. More shots followed harmlessly. Soon all was quiet, I had the road to myself, no further sign of pursuit. When I crossed the border half an hour afterward, I knew I was clear at last.  
我在城郊的一个检查站被拦住。正巧一颗炸弹在附近落下，现场一片混乱，守卫没时间审问我。我虚张声势地混了过去，继续前行。我知道自己并没有完全打消他们的疑虑，他们对我有所怀疑，但我以为他们太忙，顾不上我。然而我错了。我才开出几英里，探照灯就打亮了车子，身后传来超级摩托车的轰鸣声。一名骑手飞速超过我，命令我停车。就在前方，他猛踩刹车，站在路中央，像是在自杀，手中的枪对准我，子弹像冰雹一样打在车上弹开。我加大油门，径直撞了过去，回头一看，黑影飞过车把，摔在地上，紧接着两辆摩托车滑进了车祸现场，堆成一团。枪声持续了一会儿，但没有人追来。我希望幸存者会停下来收拾残局，给我争取足够的时间逃脱。雨停了，战斗的声音渐渐消失，我开始放松下来。

就在这时，我的车灯照到几个穿制服的身影匆忙下路，巡逻车横在路中，挡住去路，显然是有人提前打了电话。我纳闷他们为什么派出这么多人来拦截我，随即想到他们大概已经发现了应该开车的人，目标其实是他。他们开始开枪。我猛踩油门，模糊地想起典狱长讲过的冲破边境障碍的故事，车子像穿透薄纸一样冲过了路障。枪声再度响起，但并未对我造成伤害。不久后，一切都安静下来，路上只剩我一人，没有追击的迹象。半小时后，我越过边境，终于意识到自己安全了。

The chase had a bracing effect on me. Single-handed I had defeated the organized force which had been used against me. I was stimulated, as if I had won a fast and exciting game. At last I felt normal again, my old self, no longer a despairing traveler in need of help, but strong, independent, powerful. The mechanical power I controlled had become my own. I stopped to examine the car. Except for a few dents and scratches it was none the worse. The tank was still three-quarters full, the back packed with numerous cans of petrol, far more than I needed to get to my destination. I discovered a large package of food: biscuits, cheese, eggs, chocolate, apples, a bottle of rum. I should not have to bother about stopping to get supplies.  
这场追逐让我精神振奋。凭借一己之力，我击败了用来对付我的有组织力量，仿佛赢得了一场快速而刺激的游戏，我感到无比激动。终于，我又找回了自我，不再是那个绝望的旅行者，而是强大、独立、充满力量的人。我掌控的机械力量仿佛融为我的一部分。我停下来检查车况，除了几处凹痕和划痕，车子并无大碍。油箱还剩下四分之三，后备厢里装满了许多汽油罐，比我到达目的地所需的还要多。我还发现了大量的食物：饼干、奶酪、鸡蛋、巧克力、苹果，还有一瓶朗姆酒。我不必再为补给而担心了。  

Suddenly I was on the last lap of the journey. In spite of difficulties which had seemed insurmountable, my objective was almost in sight. I was pleased with my achievement, and with myself. I did not think about the killing involved. If I had acted differently I should never have got here. In any case, the hour of death had only been anticipated slightly, every living creature would soon perish. The whole world was turning toward death. Already the ice had buried millions; the survivors distracted themselves with fighting and rushing about, but always knew the invincible enemy was advancing, and that wherever they went, the ice would be there, the conqueror, in the end. The only thing was to extract what satisfaction one could from each moment. I enjoyed rushing through the night in the high-powered car, exhilarated by the speed and my own skillful driving, by the feeling of excitement and danger. When I got tired I pulled up at the roadside, slept for an hour or so.  
突然间，我进入了旅程的最后阶段。尽管曾经面对看似无法克服的困难，我的目标现在已近在眼前。我为自己的成就感到满意，也为自己感到自豪。我没有去思考过程中涉及的杀戮。如果我采取不同的行动，根本不可能到达这里。再说，死亡的时刻只是稍微提前了，每个生命体迟早都会灭亡。整个世界正在走向死亡。冰雪已经埋葬了数百万人；幸存者虽然用战争和四处奔波来分散注意力，但始终清楚无敌的敌人正在步步逼近，无论他们走到哪里，冰终将成为最终的征服者。唯一能做的就是从每一个瞬间中汲取一点满足。我享受着驾驶这辆高性能汽车在夜色中飞驰的快感，被速度、自己娴熟的驾驶技巧以及那份兴奋与危险的感觉所振奋。当我感到疲倦时，我便停在路边，睡上一个小时左右。

The cold woke me at dawn. All night long freezing stars had bombarded the earth with ice-rays, which penetrated its surface and were stored beneath, leaving only a thin crust over a reservoir of ice cold. In this sub-tropical region, to see the ground white with rime and feel it frozen hard underfoot gave the impression of having stepped out of everyday life, into a field of strangeness where no known laws operated. I ate a quick breakfast, put the engine in gear, and sped toward the horizon, toward the sea. On a good road, I drove fast, at ninety miles an hour, flying over the desolate land, at long intervals passing the remains of a house or a village. Although I never saw anyone, I could feel eyes watching me from the ruins. People saw the army car and kept quiet, did not reveal themselves; they had learned that it was safer to remain hidden.  
黎明时分，寒冷将我唤醒。整夜，冰冷的星光如冰射线般轰击大地，穿透地表，储存于地下，只留下一层薄薄的地壳覆盖在冰冷的储藏库之上。在这个亚热带地区，看到大地被霜覆盖，脚下坚硬如冰，仿佛让我踏出了日常生活，进入了一个无规律可循的陌生领域。我迅速吃完早餐，发动引擎，朝地平线、朝大海飞驰。在一条良好的道路上，我以九十英里的时速穿过荒芜的土地，偶尔经过一座废弃的房屋或村庄的残骸。虽然我从未见到任何人，但我能感觉到废墟中有目光在注视着我。人们看到了军车，保持沉默，不会暴露自己；他们已经学会了隐藏才是更安全的选择。

The day got colder as it went on, the sky darkened. Rising beyond the mountains behind me, ominous masses of black cloud were converging upon the sea. I watched these clouds, understood their meaning; felt the intensifying cold with increasing dread. I knew it meant only one thing: the glaciers were closing in. Instead of my world, there would soon be only ice, snow, stillness, death; no more violence, no war, no victims; nothing but frozen silence, absence of life. The ultimate achievement of mankind would be, not just self-destruction, but the destruction of all life; the transformation of the living world into a dead planet.  
随着时间推移，天气愈发寒冷，天空逐渐变暗。山脉彼端，乌云密布，黑色的云团正朝大海聚拢。我注视着这些云，明白了它们的意义；寒冷愈发刺骨，我的恐惧也随之加剧。我清楚这只意味着一件事：冰川正在逼近。我的世界即将被冰雪、静止和死亡所取代；不再有暴力、战争，也没有受害者，只剩下冰封的寂静和生命的消失。人类最终的成就将不仅是自我毁灭，而是所有生命的毁灭，将这个生机勃勃的世界变成一颗死寂的星球。

In a sky which should have been cloudless and burning blue, the somber, enormous structures of storm cloud looked inexpressibly sinister, threatening, like monstrous ruins on the point of collapse, hanging impossibly overhead. Icy crystalline shapes began to flower on the windscreen. I was oppressed by the sense of universal strangeness, by the chill of approaching catastrophe, the menace of ruins suspended above; and also by the enormity of what had been done, the weight of collective guilt. A frightful crime had been committed, against nature, against the universe, against life. By rejecting life, man had destroyed the immemorial order, destroyed the world; now everything was about to crash down in ruins.  
原本应该晴朗湛蓝的天空，如今被沉重庞大的风暴云笼罩着，显得无比阴森，充满威胁，宛如即将崩塌的巨大废墟，不可能地悬浮在头顶。冰冷的晶体开始在挡风玻璃上绽放。我被一种普遍的陌生感压得喘不过气，濒临灾难的寒意侵袭着我，悬在空中的废墟带来致命的威胁，同时也让我感受到人类所犯下的滔天罪行——对自然、对宇宙、对生命的背叛。人类拒绝了生命，摧毁了古老的秩序，毁灭了整个世界；如今，一切都将轰然倒塌，化为废墟。

A gull flew close and cried; I had reached the sea. I sniffed the salt smell, looked over the dark waves to the horizon, saw no wall of ice. But the air was full of the deadly coldness of ice, it could not be far away. I raced across fifty miles of bare land to the town. Above it, the clouds hung lower, blacker, more ominous, waiting for me to arrive. The cold made me shiver: perhaps he had already been there. When I slowed down and entered the streets where people had danced all night, I could hardly believe this was the same gay place. The streets were all deserted and silent; no pedestrians, no traffic, no flowers, no music, no lights. I saw sunken ships in the harbor; demolished buildings, closed shops and hotels; a cold gray light that belonged to another climate, a different part of the world; everywhere the imminent threat of a new ice age.  
一只海鸥飞近，发出尖叫声——我到了海边。我嗅到空气中的咸味，望向黑暗的海面尽头，未见冰墙的踪影。然而，空气中弥漫着致命的寒气，冰川定然不远了。我飞驰过五十英里荒凉的土地，来到小镇。头顶的云层越发低垂、黑暗，仿佛等待着我的到来。寒冷让我不由打了个冷颤：也许他已经来过了。当我减速进入那曾经整夜笙歌的街道时，几乎难以相信这是同一个地方。街道空无一人，寂静无声；没有行人，没有车辆，没有鲜花，没有音乐，没有灯光。港口里沉没的船只，废墟般的建筑，关闭的商店和酒店，笼罩着一层冰冷的灰光，仿佛来自另一个气候，另一个世界；四周弥漫着新冰河时代即将来临的威胁。

I saw what was in front of my eyes, and at the same time I saw the girl. Her picture was always with me, in my wallet and in my head. Now her image appeared in the open wherever I looked. Her white lost face was everywhere with its too-large eyes, her albino paleness flared like a torch beneath the malignant clouds, drew my eyes like a magnet. She was a shimmer among the ruins, her hair a glittering in the dark day. Her wide eyes of a wronged and terrified child accused me from the black holes of smashed windows. Like a perverted child she ran past, soliciting me with big eyes, tempting me with the pleasure of watching her pain, elaborating the worst imaginings of my desire. The ghostly gleam of her face lured me into the shadows, her hair was a cloud of light; but as I came near her she turned and fled, the silver shifting suddenly on her shoulders, a waterfall glinting in moonlight.  
我看见眼前的景象，同时也看见了那个女孩。她的照片一直在我身边，在我的钱包里，也在我的脑海中。而如今，她的身影无论我看向哪里，都会浮现。她那苍白、迷失的面容无处不在，过于巨大的眼睛，像火炬般在恶毒的乌云下闪耀，像磁石般吸引我的目光。她的身影在废墟中闪动，头发在这昏暗的日子里闪烁。她那受害又惊恐的孩子般的眼睛从破碎窗户的黑洞中指责着我。像个堕落的孩子，她从我面前跑过，用大眼睛引诱我，挑逗我以她的痛苦为乐，勾画着我欲望中最糟糕的幻想。她那幽灵般的面容在阴影中诱惑我，头发像是一团光；但当我靠近时，她转身逃走，银色的光芒突然在她肩上闪动，宛如月光下闪烁的瀑布。

The remains of a roadblock obstructed the entrance to the hotel at which we had stayed. I had to leave the car and walk up the drive. A strong wind, cruelly cold, blew straight off the ice, tore my breath away. I kept glancing at the anthracite-colored sea to make sure the ice itself was not already in sight. At ground level the exterior of the hotel was unchanged, but higher up the walls were full of great gaping holes, the roof sagged. I went inside. It was cold and dark, no heating, no light, dilapidated chairs and tables arranged as in a café. In spite of fragments of gilt decoration surviving amidst the destruction, I did not recognize the wrecked room.  
路障的残骸挡住了我们曾住过的那家酒店入口。我不得不弃车步行上坡。刺骨的寒风直从冰原吹来，夺走了我的呼吸。我不停地看向那煤灰色的海面，确保冰原还没有出现在视野中。酒店的外墙在地面上看似未变，但上部却满是巨大的破洞，屋顶也已塌陷。我走进去，里面寒冷而黑暗，没有暖气，也没有灯光，破旧的椅子和桌子依旧像咖啡馆般摆放着。尽管废墟中残存着些许镀金装饰，但我已经认不出这间破败的房间了。

I heard uneven steps, the tap of a stick, was approached by someone who knew my name. The young man’s appearance was vaguely familiar, but at first I could not place him in the dim light. Suddenly it came back to me while we were shaking hands. “Of course, you’re the proprietor’s son.” The lameness was new and had put me off. He nodded. “My parents are dead. Killed in the bombing. Officially I’m dead too.” I asked what had happened. He grimaced, touched his leg. “It was in the retreat. All the wounded were left behind. When I heard I’d been reported killed I didn’t bother to contradict . . .” He broke off, gave me a nervous glance. “But what on earth brings you back? You can’t stay here, you know. We’re in the area of immediate danger. Everyone’s been told to get out. There are only a few of us old inhabitants left.”  
我听到不均匀的脚步声和拐杖敲击地面的声音，有人走近我，竟然还知道我的名字。那年轻人的样貌让我感到隐约熟悉，但在昏暗的光线中，我一时没认出来。我们握手时，我忽然想起来了：“当然，你是老板的儿子。”他的跛足是新的，这让我一开始没认出来。他点了点头：“我父母都死了，死于轰炸。官方上我也被认为是死了。”我问他发生了什么事。他苦笑了一下，摸了摸自己的腿：“是在撤退时，所有伤员都被留在了后面。当我听到我被报告为死亡时，我也懒得去纠正了……”他停了下来，紧张地看了我一眼。“但是你到底回来干什么？你不能待在这里，知道吗？这是立即危险区，所有人都被告知要离开。这里只有我们这些老住户还留着。”

I looked at him; did not understand why he was uneasy with me. He told me the crowds of people I had seen here had left long ago. “They almost all got away before war broke out.” I said I had come in the hope of finding the girl. “But I ought to have realized that she would have gone.” I waited for him to say something about the warden. Instead, he looked awkward, hesitated before he spoke. “As a matter of fact, she’s one of the very few who did not go.” My emotions had been disturbed during the last few seconds; to disguise the fact as much as to make sure my present relief was justified, I asked if any inquiries had been made about her. “No.” He looked blank, seemed to be speaking the truth. “Does she still live here?” Again the reply was “No.” He went on: “We’ve been using this part as a restaurant, but the whole building’s unsafe. There’s nobody left to do repair work. Anyhow, what’s the use?” I agreed that the approach of the ice made all such activities futile. But I was only interested in the girl. “Where is she living now?” His hesitation was longer this time, more marked. He was obviously embarrassed by the question, and when he finally answered it, I at once saw why. “Quite near. At the beach house.” I stared at him. “I see.” Everything was clear now. I remembered the house well, it was his home, where he had lived with his parents. He continued uncomfortably: “It’s convenient for her. She’s been doing some work here.” “Really? What sort of work?” I was curious. “Oh, helping in the restaurant.” He sounded evasive, vague. “Do you mean waiting on people?” “Well, she sometimes dances . . .” As if to avoid the topic, he said: “It’s a great pity she didn’t go to a safe place like everyone else, while it was still possible. She had friends who would have taken her with them.” I replied: “Evidently she had friends here she preferred to stay with.” I watched him closely, but his face was in shadow, his back to the fading light, I could not make out his expression.  
我看着他，不明白他为什么对我感到不安。他告诉我，我之前看到的那些人群早就离开了。“战争爆发前他们几乎都走了。”我说我回来是希望找到那个女孩。“但我应该意识到她早就走了。”我等着他提起那个守卫，但他看起来有些尴尬，犹豫了一下才开口：“其实，她是少数没有走的人之一。”这几秒钟内，我的情绪被搅乱了。为了掩饰我的反应，也为了确认我的欣慰是否合理，我问道是否有人打听过她的消息。“没有。”他看起来一脸茫然，似乎是在说实话。“她还住在这里吗？”他的回答再次是否定的。“我们一直在用这地方作为餐厅，但整栋楼都不安全了，也没人留下来维修。反正，还有什么用呢？”我同意道，冰川的逼近让所有这些事情都变得毫无意义。但我只关心那个女孩。“她现在住在哪里？”他的犹豫更久了，显然被这个问题弄得很尴尬，最后终于回答时，我立刻明白了原因。“就在附近，海边的小屋。”我盯着他。“我明白了。”一切现在都清晰了。我还记得那个房子，那是他的家，他曾和父母一起住在那里。他继续不安地说道：“对她来说很方便，她一直在这里帮忙。”“真的吗？在做什么工作？”我好奇地问。“哦，帮忙照顾餐厅。”他的语气含糊不清，似乎在回避什么。“你是说为人们服务？”“嗯，她有时候会跳舞……”仿佛为了转移话题，他说：“真是遗憾，她没有像其他人一样，趁着还能走的时候去一个安全的地方。她有朋友本可以带她一起走的。”我答道：“显然，她这里也有让她愿意留下来的朋友。”我紧紧盯着他，但他背对着渐渐消失的光线，脸隐在阴影中，我无法看清他的表情。

All at once I became impatient. I had already wasted too much time on him. She was the one I had to talk to. On my way to the door I asked: “Have you any idea where I’d be likely to find her?” “I should think she’d be in her room. She’s not due here till later.” He limped after me, leaning on the stick. “I’ll show you a short cut through the garden.” I got the impression he was trying to delay me. “Many thanks: but I can find my own way.” I opened the door and went out; shut it between us before he had time to say anything more.  
突然间，我变得急躁起来。我已经在他身上浪费了太多时间。我需要和她谈话。我朝门口走去时问道：“你知道我可能在哪里找到她吗？”“我想她应该在她的房间里。她到这里的时间还早。”他拄着拐杖跟在我身后。“我会带你穿过花园的捷径。”我觉得他似乎在试图拖延时间。“谢谢，但我自己能找到路。”我推开门走了出去，在他有时间再说些什么之前把门关上。
