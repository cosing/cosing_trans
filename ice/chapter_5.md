## FIVE

My window overlooked an empty landscape where nothing ever moved. No houses were visible, only the debris of the collapsed wall, a bleak stretch of snow, the fjord, the fir forest, the mountains. No color, only monotonous shades of gray from black to the ultimate dead white of the snow. The water lifeless in its dead calm, the ranks of black trees marching everywhere in uniform gloom. Suddenly there was a movement, a shout of red and blue in that silent gray monotone. I seized my overcoat, struggled into it as I rushed to the door; changed my mind and went back to the window, which was stuck fast. I managed to heave it up, stepped out on to piles of rubble, then pulled it shut behind me with the tips of my fingers. Slithering on the frozen grass, I ran down the slope; it was the quickest way; and I had eluded the woman of the house, whom I suspected of keeping watch on my movements. There was no one on the narrow path skirting the fjord, but the person I was chasing could not be far off. The path plunged into the forest. At once it got colder and darker under the trees, which grew close together, their black branches meeting in dense entanglements overhead, intertwining with the undergrowth lower down. Twenty invisible people could have been near me, but I saw the ghostly gray coat flicker among the firs, and occasionally caught a glimpse of its checked lining. The wearer’s head was uncovered: her bright hair shimmered like silver fire, an ignis fatuus glimmering in the forest. She hurried on as fast as she could, anxious to get out of the trees. She was nervous in the forest, which always seemed full of menace. The crowding trees unnerved her, transformed themselves into black walls, shutting her in. It was late, after sunset; she had come too far and must hurry back. She looked about for the fjord, failed to see it, lost her bearings, and at once became really frightened, terrified of being overtaken by night in the dark forest. Fear was the climate she lived in; if she had ever known kindness it would have been different. The trees seemed to obstruct her with deliberate malice. All her life she had thought of herself as a foredoomed victim, and now the forest had become the malign force that would destroy her. In desperation she tried to run, but a hidden root tripped her, she almost fell. Branches caught in her hair, tugged her back, lashed out viciously when they were disentangled. The silver hairs torn from her head glittered among black needles; they were the clues her pursuers would follow, leading them to their victim. She escaped from the forest at length only to see the fjord waiting for her. An evil effluence rose from the water, something primitive, savage, demanding victims, hungry for a human victim.  
我的窗外是一片空旷的景象，死寂沉沉，什么也没有动静。看不见任何房屋，只看到坍塌的墙壁的废墟，一片荒凉的积雪，峡湾，冷杉森林，还有远处的山脉。没有任何色彩，只有单调的灰色调，从黑色到死白色的雪地。水面静止不动，毫无生气，黑压压的树木一排排地延伸到各处，笼罩在一片阴郁之中。突然间，在那一片寂静的灰色中，一抹红色和蓝色的身影闪动起来，打破了这死寂。我急忙抓起外套，边向门口奔去边费力地穿上；突然改变了主意，又回到窗前，发现窗户被卡住了。我费力地把窗户推开，踏上了窗外的瓦砾堆，然后用指尖把窗户拉上。滑过冻硬的草地，我快速下坡奔跑；这是最快的路；而且我成功躲过了那个我怀疑在监视我行动的女房东。狭窄的小路沿着峡湾蜿蜒前行，但我追逐的人应该就在不远处。小路进入了森林，那里变得更加寒冷和昏暗，树木紧密地挨在一起，黑色的树枝在头顶交织在一起，和下面的灌木纠缠在一起。可能有二十个隐形人藏在周围，但我看到了那件幽灵般的灰色外套在冷杉间闪动，偶尔还能瞥见它的格子衬里。穿着外套的人没有戴帽子：她那明亮的头发像银色的火焰一样闪烁，仿佛是森林中的鬼火。她尽可能快地前行，迫不及待地想要离开这些树木。她在森林里总是感到不安，这里总是充满了威胁。密集的树木让她紧张，它们变成了黑色的墙壁，把她困在其中。天已经晚了，太阳已经落山；她走得太远，必须赶紧回去。她环顾四周寻找峡湾，但没能看到，立刻感到害怕，害怕在黑暗的森林里被夜晚吞没。恐惧是她生活的一部分；如果她曾经体验过善意，情况会完全不同。树木似乎带着恶意阻碍她。她一生都认为自己是注定的牺牲品，而现在，森林变成了要毁灭她的邪恶力量。她绝望地试图奔跑，但一根隐藏的树根绊了她一下，她几乎摔倒。树枝缠住了她的头发，拉着她不放，等到挣脱时，又恶狠狠地抽打她。被扯下的银色头发在黑色的针叶间闪闪发光；它们成了追捕她的线索，引导他们找到猎物。她终于从森林中逃脱，却看到峡湾在等着她。一股邪恶的气息从水中升起，那是原始的、野蛮的气息，渴望一个牺牲品，渴求一个人类的牺牲品。

For a second she stood still, appalled by the absolute silence and loneliness all around. A new ferocity pervaded the landscape now that night was approaching. She saw the massed armies of forest trees encamped on all sides, the mountain wall above bristling with trees like guns. Below, the fjord was an impossible icy volcano erupting the baleful fire of the swallowed sun.  
她愣了一会儿，周围绝对的静谧和孤独让她震惊。随着夜幕降临，一种新的凶猛气息弥漫在整个景象中。她看到森林像军队一样密密麻麻地包围着四周，山墙上密集的树木如同排列整齐的火炮。下方的峡湾宛如一个冰封的火山，喷发着被吞噬的太阳那凶恶的火焰。

In the deepening dusk every horror could be expected. She was afraid to look, tried not to see the spectral shapes rising from the water, but felt them come gliding toward her and fled in panic. One overtook her, wound her in soft, clammy, adhesive bands like ectoplasm. Wildly choking a scream, she fought herself free, raced on blindly, frantic and gasping. Her brain was locked in nightmare, she did not think. The last light fading, she stumbled against unseen rocks, bruising knees and elbows. Thorns lacerated her hands, scratched her face. Her flying leaps shattered the thin ice at the fjord’s edge and she was deluged in freezing water. Each breath was painful, a sharp knife repeatedly stabbing her chest. She dared not stop or slacken speed for an instant, terrified by the loud thud of pursuing steps close behind her, not recognizing her own agonized heartbeats. Suddenly she slipped on the edge of a snowdrift, could not stop herself, fell face down in a deep snow-grave. There was snow in her mouth, she was done for, finished, she would never get up again, could not run any further. Cruelly straining muscles relentlessly forced her up, she had to struggle on, pulled by the irresistible magnet of doom. Systematic bullying when she was most vulnerable had distorted the structure of her personality, made a victim of her, to be destroyed, either by things or by human beings, people or fjords and forests; it made no difference, in any case she could not escape. The irreparable damage inflicted had long ago rendered her fate inevitable.  
在日益加深的暮色中，一切恐怖都似乎即将来临。她不敢看，努力不去看那些从水中升起的幽灵般的形体，但她感到它们向她滑行过来，惊恐地逃走了。有一个追上她，用柔软、湿冷而粘稠的带子缠住她，如同灵异物质一般。她拼命压抑住一声尖叫，挣脱了出来，盲目地奔跑着，恐慌而喘息不已。她的大脑陷入噩梦之中，无法思考。最后的光线渐渐消失，她撞上了看不见的岩石，膝盖和肘部都被撞伤了。荆棘划破了她的手，划伤了她的脸。她飞奔的脚步打破了峡湾边缘的薄冰，她浸入了冰冷的水中。每一次呼吸都像是锋利的刀片不断刺入她的胸口。她不敢停下或放慢速度，惊恐于紧追在身后的脚步声，不明白那其实是自己痛苦的心跳。突然，她在一个雪堆边滑倒，无法停止自己，脸朝下跌入了一座深深的雪墓。雪进了她的嘴里，她完了，结束了，她再也无法站起来，无法再跑下去。残酷地扭动肌肉，无情地迫使她爬起，她不得不继续挣扎，被命运的不可抗拒的力量拉扯着。系统性的欺凌在她最脆弱的时候扭曲了她的性格结构，让她成为了一个受害者，无论是被人还是被自然，森林或峡湾摧毁，这并没有区别，无论如何她都无法逃脱。早已造成的无法弥补的伤害使她的命运变得不可避免。

A pitch black mass of rock loomed ahead, a hill, a mountain, an unlighted fortress, buttressed by regiments of black firs. Her weak hands were shaking too much to manipulate a door, but the waiting forces of doom dragged her inside.  
一座漆黑的岩石块在前方隐现，一座小山、一座山峰，一座未照明的堡垒，由密密麻麻的黑色杉树支撑着。她的双手太虚弱了，无法推开门，但命运的无情力量将她拖进了里面。

Stretched out on her bed, she could feel the hostile, alien, freezing dark pressed to the wall like the ear of a listening enemy. In the utter silence and solitude, she lay watching the mirror, waiting for her fate to arrive. It would not be long now. She knew that something fearful was going to happen in the soundproof room, where nobody could or would come to her rescue. The room was antagonistic as it always had been. She was aware of the walls refusing protection, of the frigid hostility in the air. There was nothing she could do, no one to whom she could appeal. Abandoned, helpless, she could only wait for the end.  


A woman came in without knocking and stood in the doorway, handsome, forbidding, dressed all in black, tall and menacing as a tree, followed by other indistinct shapes, which kept to the shadows behind her. The girl at once recognized her executioner, whose enmity she had always felt without understanding it, too innocent or too preoccupied with her own dream world to guess the obvious cause. Now, cold bright pitiless eyes swam in the glassy depths of the mirror, darted toward their victim. Her eyes were widely dilated and black with dread, two deep pits of terror, of intuitive nightmare foreknowledge. Then a sense of fatality overcame her; she experienced a regression, became a submissive, terrorized child, cowed by persistent ill-treatment. Intimidated, obedient to the woman’s commanding voice, she got up and with faltering steps left the platform, her white face blank as paper. When her arms were seized she cried out, struggled feebly. A hand was clamped over her mouth. Several figures towered above her. She was gripped from all sides, roughly handled, hustled out of the room, her hands tied behind her back.  


Under the trees it got darker and darker, I kept losing sight of the path. In the end I lost it entirely and came out at a different place. I was close to the wall. It was impressive, intact, no break in it anywhere; I saw the black shapes of sentries posted along the top. Two of them were approaching each other and would cross quite near me. I stood still in the shadow of the black trees where I should not be seen. Their steps were loud, the hard frost magnified every sound. They met, stamped their feet, exchanged passwords, separated again. I walked on when the footsteps grew fainter. I had a curious feeling that I was living on several planes simultaneously; the overlapping of these planes was confusing. Huge rounded boulders as big as houses, resembling the heads of decapitated giants, were lying near, where they had fallen long ago from the mountainside. Suddenly I heard voices, looked everywhere, but could see no one. The sound seemed to come from among the boulders, so I went to investigate. A light flowered yellow in the blue dusk: I was looking at a cottage, not a mass of rock. People were talking inside it.  


I heard yells, crashes, the frightened neighing of horses, all the noises of battle. Arrows flew in clouds. War clubs thumped. There was loud clashing of steel. Strangely dressed men came at the wall in waves, swarming up it, using their feet as well as their hands, holding cutlasses in their teeth. Agile as gorillas, they came in their thousands; however many were thrown back, a new wave always came on. Finally all the defenders of the wall were exterminated, the second line defenses forced back. Invaders already inside opened the gates, and the rest burst in like a tidal wave. People barricaded themselves in their houses. In the town there was utter chaos. Hand-to-hand fighting in the narrow streets; savage meaningless cries like the cries of wild animals resounding between the walls. The strangers raced through the town like madmen, pouring wine down their throats, slaughtering all they met, every man, woman, child, animal. The wine streamed down their faces mingled with sweat and blood so that they looked like demons. A little snow fell: this seemed to excite them to frenzy, they laughed insanely, tried to catch the falling flakes in their mouths. The horsemen carried long lances with pennants or feathers attached. Hacked-off heads were impaled on these lances, sometimes infants or dogs. Huge fires blazed everywhere, it was as bright as day. The air was full of the reek of burning, of charred wood and old dust. As people were smoked out of their homes they were massacred by the enemy. Many preferred to die in the flames.  


I had no weapon, and searched for something with which to defend myself. I was in a street where dead horses had been piled up to form a barricade, among them a man who had been killed with his mount. He had not had time even to draw his sword, which was still in the scabbard, engraved with intricate patterns, a beautiful piece of work. I tugged at the projecting hilt, but in falling the blade had jammed and I could not move it. The dead beasts had been heaped up in such frantic haste that my persistent efforts were shaking the whole construction; carcasses worked loose, rolled down, forming a breech. Before I could repair the damage, a troop of horsemen galloped along the street with a fearful clattering din, waving their lances, yelling their senseless cries. I threw myself flat on the ground, hoping they had not seen me, expecting the worst. As they came up, one of them jabbed his long lance ahead of him into the dead rider, dislodging the body so violently that it fell on top of me, probably saving my life. I kept perfectly still while the whole troop went careering past, rolling their bloodshot, demented, animalic eyes.  


When they had gone, I pushed the corpse aside and got up to go and search for the girl. I had not much hope of finding her; I knew the fate of girls in sacked towns. The sword was loose now, I pulled it out easily. I had never used such a weapon and tried slashing at some of the bodies I passed. The thing was heavy and hard to handle, but I discovered the balance and began to get the feel of it as I walked, thus gaining some much-needed confidence. As it happened, I was not attacked. Most of the fighting was going on in the lower streets, round the harbor forts, which appeared to be holding out. When I saw anyone I took cover, and in the general confusion escaped observation. The High House was almost burned out already, only the shell still standing. Smoke and flames spouted toward the sky, the whole interior was incandescent. I approached as close as I could, but was driven back by the smoke and the intense heat. It was quite impossible to get inside. In any case, nobody could have survived in such an inferno. My face was scorched, sparks were smoldering in my hair, I crushed them out with my hands.  


I came upon her by chance, not far away, lying face down on the stones. A little blood had trickled out of her mouth. Her neck had an unnatural twist; a living girl could not have turned her head at that angle: the neck was broken. She had been dragged by the hair, hands which had twisted it into a sort of rope had dulled its silvery brightness. On her back blood was still fresh in places, wet and bright red; in other places it had caked black on the white flesh. I looked particularly at one arm, on which the circular marks of teeth stood out clearly. The bones of the forearm were broken, the sharp pointed ends of bone projected at the wrist through the torn tissue. I felt I had been defrauded: I alone should have done the breaking with tender love; I was the only person entitled to inflict wounds. I leaned forward and touched her cold skin.  


I went to look in at the cottage window, taking care not to go near enough to be seen from inside. A lot of people were crowded into a small smoky room, firelight flickering red on their faces, reminding me of a medieval picture of hell. At first I could not make out any words; they were all talking at once. I recognized one woman, unusually tall, handsome in a forbidding way; I had seen her at the High House. Now she was with a man she called father who sat just inside the window. Because he was so close to me, his was the first voice I understood. He was relating the legend of the fjord, how every year at the winter solstice a beautiful girl had to be sacrificed to the dragon that lived in its depths. The other voices gradually became silent when he began describing the rite itself. “We untie her as soon as we get her up there on the rock. She must struggle a bit, otherwise the dragon might think we’d palmed off a dead girl on him. The water foams down below. The monster’s great scaly coils appear. Then we hurl her down. The whole fjord becomes a maelstrom, blood and foam flying in all directions.”  


A lively discussion of the sacrifice followed, different people speaking in turn. They might have been talking about a football match between their team and a rival town. Somebody said: “We haven’t so many good-looking girls to spare. Why should we give one of them to the dragon? Why not sacrifice a stranger, some foreign girl who means nothing to any of us?” The tone of voice suggested that the speaker referred to a special person, whose identity was known to all present. The father started raising objections, but was silenced by his daughter, who called out her agreement, launching into a vicious tirade of which I only caught isolated phrases. “Pale girls who look as pure as if they were made of glass . . . smash them to smithereens . . . And I will smash this one . . .” The end was shouted. “I’ll hurl her down off the rock myself, if none of you have the guts to do it!”  


I walked away in disgust. These people were worse than savages. My hands and face were numb, I felt half frozen, and could not think why I had stood there so long listening to their preposterous rigmarole. I had a vague feeling that something was wrong with me, although I could not decide what it was. For a moment this was disturbing; then I forgot it. A small, cold, bright moon shone high in the sky, showed the landscape distinctly. I recognized the fjord but not the scene. Tall perpendicular rocks rose straight out of the water, supporting a flat horizontal rock like a high-diving platform. Some people appeared, dragging the girl between them, her hands tied. As she passed me, I caught a glimpse of her pitiful white face of a child-victim, terrified and betrayed. I sprang forward, tried to reach her, to cut her bonds. Somebody went for me. I threw him off, tried again to get near her, she was dragged away. I rushed after the group, shouting: “Murderers!” Before I could overtake them, they were hauling her up the rock.  


I was close to her on the platform high above the fjord. We were alone there, although a mixture of vague sounds behind me indicated the presence of numerous onlookers. They did not concern me. I was completely concentrated on the trembling figure, half kneeling, half crouching, at the extremity of the rock, overhanging the dark water. Her hair glittered as if with diamond dust under the moon. She was not looking at me, but I could see her face, which was always pale, but now drained of color right to the bone. I observed her extreme slenderness, felt I could enclose the whole of her with my two hands, even the rib-cage containing her heart. Her skin was like white satin, shadowless in the brilliant moonlight. The circular marks the cords had left on her wrists would have been red in daylight, but now looked black. I could imagine how it would feel to take hold of her wrists and to snap the fragile bones with my hands.  


Leaning forward, I touched her cold skin, the shallow hollow in her thigh. Snow had fallen between her breasts.  
我向前倾身，触摸她冰冷的皮肤，大腿上的浅浅凹陷处。雪花落在她的胸间。

Armed men came up, pushed me back, seized her by her frail shoulders. Big tears fell from her eyes like icicles, like diamonds, but I was unmoved. They did not seem to me like real tears. She herself did not seem quite real. She was pale and almost transparent, the victim I used for my own enjoyment in dreams. People behind me muttered, impatient at the delay. The men did not wait any longer but hurled her down, her last pathetic scream trailing after her. The night exploded then like a paper bag. Huge jets of water sprang up; waves dashing wildly against the rocks burst in cascades of spray. I hardly noticed the freezing showerbath, but peered over the edge of the platform, and saw a circle of scaly coils emerge from the seething water, in which something white struggled frantically for an instant before the crunch of armor-plated jaws.  
武装的士兵上前，将我推开，抓住她那纤弱的肩膀。她眼中流下大滴的泪水，如同冰柱，如同钻石，但我无动于衷。这泪水对我而言并不真实。她本人也显得不太真实，苍白而近乎透明，像是我在梦中用来取乐的牺牲品。身后的人们低声抱怨，因耽搁而不耐烦。士兵们没有再等，猛地将她推下，她那最后凄惨的尖叫声在身后回荡。夜空仿佛纸袋般爆裂开来。巨大的水柱喷涌而起，狂浪撞击岩石，溅起飞舞的水花。我几乎没注意到冰冷的水淋浴，只是探头望向平台的边缘，看见一个圈状的鳞片躯体从沸腾的水中浮现出来，那白色的身影在其中拼命挣扎了片刻，随后便被坚硬的铠甲般的颚齿咬住，消失不见。

I was in a hurry to get back to my lodging. My feet and fingers were numb, my face stiff, my head starting to ache with the cold. As soon as I had thawed out a little in my warm room, I began to write. My main topic, of course, was the Indris, but I still kept up the pretense I had started by writing down anything that seemed of interest about the town. I did not think the security people would bother to read my notes, although they could easily do so while I was out of the room. The childishly simple form of scrambling I used, mixing up sentences about the lemurs with others on local affairs, would at least defeat the woman of the house, who pried into everything.  
我急匆匆地赶回住处，双脚和双手都冻得麻木，脸部僵硬，头部也开始因为寒冷而隐隐作痛。一回到温暖的房间稍微暖和了一些后，我便开始写作。主要的话题自然是关于狐猴的研究，但我仍旧继续着之前的伪装，写下了一些关于小镇的有趣事物。我并不认为安全部门会费心阅读我的笔记，虽然他们很容易在我外出时查看。我用一种幼稚简单的方式将内容打乱，把关于狐猴的句子和当地事务的句子混合在一起，这至少可以蒙混过那个无所不查的房东太太。

I derived great satisfaction from describing the gentle mysterious singing creatures, and seemed to grow more deeply involved with them as I wrote. With their enchanting other-world voices, their gay, affectionate, innocent ways, they had become for me symbols of life as it could be on earth, if man’s destructiveness, violence and cruelty were eliminated. I enjoyed writing as a rule, the sentences came to me without effort, as if they formed in my head of their own accord. But now it was quite different, I could not find the right words: I knew I was not expressing myself lucidly, or remembering accurately, and after some minutes put down my pen. Immediately I saw a mental picture of many people crowded into a smoky room, and felt I ought to inform the warden of what I had overheard. At the same time, there was a curious unreality about the memory of that scene, as if I could have dreamt it. And when it occurred to me that the girl might be in real danger I did not quite believe this. I got up, all the same, to go to the telephone. Then, restrained by the peculiar uncertainty as to what was real more than the thought of the woman who would be listening to every word, I decided not to ring up until I got to the café.  
我从描述那些温柔而神秘的鸣唱生物中获得了极大的满足，随着写作的进行，我仿佛与它们建立了更加深刻的联系。它们那充满魔力的异界嗓音、欢快亲切的天真举止，已经成为我心中地球上理想生活的象征——一种没有人类破坏、暴力和残酷的生活。我通常很享受写作，句子自然地流淌出来，仿佛在脑海中自然而然地成形。然而这次却完全不同，我找不到合适的词语，无法清晰地表达自己，也无法准确地回忆，在写了几分钟后就放下了笔。此刻，我脑海中浮现出许多人挤在一个烟雾缭绕的房间里的画面，觉得应该把我听到的事情告知守卫。然而，这段记忆带有一种奇怪的不真实感，仿佛是我在梦中见到的。当我想到那个女孩可能真的处于危险中时，却又不太相信这是真的。我起身打算去打电话，但被那种不确定感所阻止——这种不确定感甚至比想到那个会偷听我每一句话的女人更强烈。我决定等到去了咖啡馆再拨打电话。

My sense of unreality became overwhelming as I left the house. A strong colorless light was making everything outside as clear as day, although I was quite unable to see where it came from. My amazement increased when I observed that this extraordinary light revealed details not normally visible to the naked eye. It was snowing slightly, and the complex structure of each individual snowflake appeared in crystalline clearness, the delicate star-like, flower-like forms perfectly distinct and as bright as jewels. I looked round for the familiar ruins, but they were no longer there. I was used to the sight of destruction, but this was different. Nothing whatever was left of the ruined town; its structures had disintegrated, the remains were flattened, spread as though a giant steam-roller had passed over them. The one or two vertical fragments seemed to have been left intentionally, with the deliberate object of emphasizing the general leveling. With a dreamlike feeling, I walked on, seeing no one, either alive or dead. The air was full of a sweetish smell, not unpleasant, which I could smell on my own hands and clothes, and presumed had been left by some gas. The absence of fires surprised me; nothing seemed to be burning, I saw no smoke. I only now noticed thin trickles of a white milky fluid moving among the debris, collecting in pools here and there. These white pools continually widened as the liquid eroded their edges, eating away whatever came in contact with it; it was only a question of time before the entire mass of wreckage would be disposed of in this way. I stood still for a moment to watch the process, fascinated by such a practical, thorough method of clearance. I remembered that I had to find the girl, searched for her desperately through the endless rubble. I thought I saw her a long way off in the distance, shouted, ran; she changed, disappeared. Like a mirage I saw her still further away; then she vanished again. A girl’s arm protruded from a heap of detritus; I took hold of the wrist, pulled gently; it came away in my hand. All at once I heard sounds and movements behind me, quickly swung round, caught sight of living objects which moved with a gliding motion, made warbling noises. Their shapes were queer, only partially human, reminding me of mutants in science fiction stories. They took no notice of me, ignored my existence completely, and I hurried on without going any closer.  
我离开房子时，那种不真实感变得愈发强烈。外面一种无色的强光使一切都如同白昼般清晰，我却完全看不出这光线的来源。更让我惊奇的是，这种奇异的光线竟然揭示了平常肉眼难以察觉的细节。雪花轻轻飘落，每片雪花的复杂结构在晶莹剔透的光芒中清晰可见，那精致的星状和花状形态仿佛宝石般明亮。我环顾四周寻找熟悉的废墟，却发现它们已经不见了。尽管我已经习惯了毁灭的景象，但这次完全不同。废墟小镇什么都没有留下，其建筑已经分崩离析，遗骸被夷为平地，仿佛被一台巨大的压路机碾压过。那一两个竖立的残片似乎是故意留下的，目的是为了更突出整体的平整。带着一种梦幻般的感觉，我继续向前走，没有看到任何人，无论是生者还是死者。空气中充满了一种甜腻的气味，不难闻，我闻到了自己手上和衣服上的味道，猜测这是某种气体留下的痕迹。没有火焰的存在令我惊讶，什么都没有燃烧，我也没有看到烟雾。此时我才注意到，一种乳白色的薄薄液体在废墟中蜿蜒流动，汇集成一片片水洼。这些白色水洼不断扩大，液体侵蚀着其接触到的任何物体；只需要时间，整个废墟的残骸就会以这种方式被处理掉。我停下来片刻，出于好奇，观察着这个如此实用、彻底的清理过程。我记得我得找到那个女孩，在无尽的瓦砾中拼命寻找她。我仿佛看见她在远处，便大声呼喊，奔跑过去；她变幻身影，消失了。像海市蜃楼一样，我又看见她在更远的地方，然后她再次消失。一只女孩的手臂从一堆碎片中伸出，我抓住手腕，轻轻一拉，手腕就脱落在我手中。突然，我听到背后有声音和动静，迅速转身，看到一些滑行的生物，它们发出啭鸣声。这些生物形态奇特，只是部分像人类，让我想起了科幻小说中的变异体。它们对我视而不见，完全无视我的存在，于是我赶紧继续前行，尽量不靠近它们。

When I came to a place where bodies were lying about, I stopped to examine them in case one was hers. I went up to the nearest corpse and looked at it carefully. It was not recognizable, the skeleton and what was left of the flesh had become phosphorescent. To look at the others would only be wasting time, so I left them alone.  
当我来到一个散落着尸体的地方，我停下来仔细检查，看看是否有她的身影。我走到最近的一具尸体跟前，仔细地观察着。它已经不可辨认，骨架和剩下的肉体已经变成磷光的样子。再去看其他尸体只会浪费时间，所以我放弃了。
