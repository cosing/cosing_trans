## SIX

The owner of the house heard me pass her door, opened it, peered out frowning. I pretended not to have seen her and hurried on, but the outer door would not move, there was some obstruction. I pushed hard, scattering the snow piled against it, and letting in icy wind that rattled something behind me. There was an angry shout, “Mind what you’re doing!” which I ignored.  
房子的主人听见我经过她的门口，打开门，皱着眉头向外窥探。我假装没有看到她，匆匆前行。然而外面的门却纹丝不动，似乎有什么东西挡住了它。我用力推开，散落在门前的积雪纷纷扬扬，冷风呼啸而入，后面传来一阵响动。一个愤怒的声音喊道：“注意你在做什么！”我没有理会。

Outside I was astonished by the quantity of snow that had fallen. A different town, white and spectral, had replaced the old one. The few feeble lights showed how the shapes of the ruins were altered by their thick white covering, the details of destruction obscured, all outlines muffled and blurred. The effect of the heavy snowfall was to deprive structures of solidity and precise location: my old impression revived of a scene made of nylon with nothing behind. Only a few snowflakes were in the air at first; then a white flurry passed me, driven along parallel to the ground by the strong wind. I lowered my head against this freezing wind, and saw the small grains of snow, dry and frozen, swirling round my legs. The flurries thickened, became incessant, filling the air; I could not see where I was. I got only intermittent glimpses of my surroundings, which seemed vaguely familiar, and yet distorted, unreal. My ideas were confused. In a peculiar way, the unreality of the outer world appeared to be an extension of my own disturbed state of mind.  
走出门外，我惊讶于积雪的厚度。旧城已被一个白色而幽灵般的新城所取代。仅有的几盏微弱灯光展示了废墟的形状如何被厚厚的白雪覆盖，破坏的细节被掩盖，所有轮廓都模糊不清。厚重的降雪使建筑失去了坚实感和明确的位置，唤起了我过去那种仿佛在尼龙制成的场景中，背后什么都没有的感觉。起初，空中只有几片雪花，然后一阵白色的雪花飘过我身旁，被强风平行吹向地面。我低下头抵挡这刺骨的寒风，看到干燥而冰冷的小雪粒在我腿周围旋转。雪花越来越密，不断充满空气，我看不清我身在何处。我只能断断续续地瞥见四周的景象，那些景象似乎模糊而熟悉，又扭曲不真实。我的思绪混乱了。以一种奇怪的方式，外部世界的虚幻似乎是我自己混乱心境的延伸。

Collecting my thoughts with an effort, I remembered that the girl was in danger and must be warned. I gave up trying to find the café, and decided to go straight to the warden. I could just make out the fort-like mass of his home looming over the town.  
我努力整理思绪，想起那个女孩正处于危险之中，必须提醒她。我放弃了去找咖啡馆的念头，决定直接去找监护人。我隐约看到他那堡垒般的住所在小镇上空隐现。

Except for the main square, the streets were always deserted after dark, so I was amazed to see quite a number of figures climbing the steep hill in front of me. Next moment I remembered hearing talk, without paying attention, of some public dinner or celebration at the High House, which evidently was being held tonight. I reached the entrance only a few steps behind the nearest group of people, and was glad they were there; without them, I should not have been sure this was the right place, the snow made everything look so different. Two hillocks, one on each side, might have been the batteries; but there were other white mounds I could not account for. A cluster of long pointed icicles, sharp as swords, clung to a lantern over the huge main door, glistening ferociously in the dim light. As those ahead of me were admitted, I stepped forward and went inside with them. The guards would most likely have let me in if I had been alone, but this seemed the easiest way.  
夜幕降临后，除了主广场外，街道上总是空无一人，所以当我看到前面陡坡上有不少人影在攀爬时，我感到非常惊讶。下一刻，我想起了曾无意间听到的关于高邸今晚举办公共晚宴或庆典的谈论，显然这就是今晚的活动。我到达入口时，离前面一组人只有几步之遥，并为他们的存在感到高兴；要不是他们在，我几乎不敢确定这就是正确的地方，因为雪让一切看起来如此不同。两座小山丘，一边一个，可能是防御工事；但还有其他白色土丘，我无法解释。一簇长长的尖冰柱，如同利剑般锋利，紧紧附在巨大的正门上方的灯笼上，在昏暗的光线中闪烁着狰狞的光芒。前面的人被准许进入时，我紧跟着上前，和他们一起走了进去。守卫很可能也会让我独自进去，但这种方式显然最省事。

Nobody took the least notice of me. I must have been recognized, but received no sign of recognition from anyone, felt increasingly derealized, as familiar faces came up and passed me without a glance. The gloomy great place was already crowded, the group I had come in with must have been one of the last. If this was a celebration, it was singularly subdued. All the faces were dour as usual; there was no laughing and little talking. Such conversation as went on took place in tones too low to be overheard.  
没有人注意到我。我应该是被认出来了，但没有任何人对我表示认知，这种感觉让我越来越感到不真实。熟悉的面孔一个个走过，无一人向我投来一瞥。这座阴郁的大厅已经人满为患，我和我一起进来的那一组人应该是最后一批。如果这是一个庆典，那么显然异常低调。所有的面孔都如往常一样阴沉，没有笑声，几乎没有交谈。即使有少许交谈，也是用极低的声音进行，根本听不清楚。

Ceasing to notice the people, I considered how I was to reach the girl. The warden had taken me to the door of her room, but I knew I would never be able to find it again without a guide. Somebody would have to help me. Wondering who would be the best person to approach, I wandered from room to room, presently found myself in a huge vaulted hall, where trestle tables had been set up, with jugs and bottles of wine and spirits placed at intervals between vast platters of meat and bread. Standing in a dark corner where I would not be seen, I watched the servants bringing in more plates of food and arranging them on the tables. In spite of an almost feverish anxiety over the girl, instead of attempting to find her I stood there doing nothing at all; became aware of an odd sort of fragmentation of my ideas.  
停止关注周围的人后，我开始考虑如何才能找到那个女孩。守卫曾带我到她房间的门口，但我知道，如果没有向导，我永远找不到那扇门。于是，我想着谁会是最合适的人来帮助我，开始在房间间徘徊，不久发现自己来到一个巨大的拱顶大厅。大厅里设有临时的长桌，桌上间隔放置着酒壶和瓶子，还有巨大的肉类和面包拼盘。我站在一个黑暗的角落里，别人看不见的地方，观察着仆人们端着更多的菜肴进来，将它们摆放在桌上。尽管对那个女孩的焦虑几乎达到了狂热的程度，我却并没有试图去寻找她，只是呆在那里，什么都没有做，意识到自己思绪变得异常零散。

Hundreds of torches flared, lighting the great hall, a banquet had been arranged to celebrate victory. I went first with one of my aides to look over the prisoners. It was the commander’s traditional privilege, a routine. The women were herded together behind a barrier. They had already retreated as far from everyone as they could, but when they saw us coming contrived to move back further still, pressing against the wall. They did not attract me. I could not tell one from another; suffering had given them all the same features. In other parts of the hall there was much noise, but here only silence; no pleadings, no curses, no lamentations; just staring eyes, the red flicker of torchlight on naked limbs, breasts.  
数百支火炬燃烧着，照亮了宽敞的大厅，这里正为庆祝胜利而举办盛宴。我和我的一名助手率先去查看俘虏。这是指挥官的传统特权，例行公事。女人们被集中在一条屏障后。她们已经尽可能地远离所有人，但当她们看到我们走过来时，又竭力向后退，紧紧贴在墙上。她们对我没有吸引力。我无法区分她们的面孔，苦难使她们都长得一样。在大厅的其他地方噪声很大，但这里只有沉默；没有哀求，没有诅咒，也没有悲叹；只有凝视的眼睛，火炬的红光在裸露的四肢和胸脯上闪烁。

Torches were fixed like bundles of rockets to the enormous pillars supporting the high arched roof. Leaning against one of these pillars a young girl stood a little apart, unclothed except by her shining hair. The death of hope had tranquilized her white face. She was scarcely more than a child, did not see us; her eyes were looking far inward at dreams. Arms like peeled wands, silvery streaming hair . . . a young moon among clouds . . . I wanted to stay and watch her. But they came to escort me to the presence.  
火炬像火箭束一样固定在支撑高拱屋顶的巨大柱子上。一个年轻的女孩倚靠在其中一根柱子上，与众人稍稍隔开，她身上除了那光亮的头发外，别无他物。希望的消逝使她的白皙面庞显得平静。她几乎还是个孩子，未曾注意到我们；她的眼睛望向远方，沉浸在梦境中。那双像剥皮柳枝般的手臂，银色流动的头发……犹如云中新月……我想留下来观看她。但有人前来护送我去见尊者。

His splendid gold seat was carved with the faces and exploits of heroes, his ancestors. His magnificent cloak, lined with sable and gold-embroidered, draped his knees in stiff statuesque folds. Sparks dripped from the torches and warmed the cold white of his long, thin, restless hands. A blue flash from his eyes: a matching blue flash from a tremendous jewel worn on his hand. I did not know the name of this stone. Neither his hands nor his eyes were ever at rest, there was a constant bombardment of blue. He would not let me move to a different place, kept me standing beside him. Because I had led the victorious army, he gave me a glittering order I did not want: I had too many already. I told him I only wanted the girl. A gasp went up. The people round him waited to see me struck down. I was indifferent. I had lived half my life, seen as much as I wanted. I was sick of war, sick of serving this difficult, dangerous master who loved war and killing and nothing else. There was a kind of insanity in his war-making. Conquest was not enough. He wanted a war of extermination, all enemies slaughtered without exception, nobody left alive. He wanted to kill me. But, although he could not live without war, he was unable to plan a campaign, take a city; I had to do that. So he could not kill me. He wanted my war skills and he wanted me dead. Now he gave me a deadly glance, kept me at his side; but, at the same time, beckoned closer those standing round him. They formed a close sycophantic circle, the only gap was the point where I stood. A small man slipped in, crept under my arm, lifted a long-nosed face like a vicious dog ready to bite, cringing before his master, snarling at me. Now the circle was closed. But I could still watch the ring flashing blue, the gesticulations of the unquiet hands, their long thin white fingers and long pointed nails. The fingers curved inwards in a strange way, like a strangler’s, the blue stone was anchored by the curved bone. Commands were given, too low for me to hear. Earlier, he had praised my skill and courage extravagantly, promised me great rewards, I was his guest of honor. I knew him well, could well imagine what sort of reward he planned for me now. I had already prepared my face.  
他那壮丽的金色座椅上雕刻着英雄及其祖先的面容与事迹。他披着镶有金丝刺绣、内衬貂皮的华美斗篷，僵硬地垂挂在双膝上，如雕塑般静止不动。火炬滴落的火星温暖着他那冰冷而苍白、纤细且不安分的长手。一道蓝光闪过他的眼睛，与他手上佩戴的巨大宝石闪烁出相匹配的蓝光。我不知这颗宝石的名称。他的手和眼睛始终不曾安宁，蓝光不停地迸发。他不让我挪动一步，将我留在他身旁。由于我率领了胜利的军队，他给了我一个闪闪发光的勋章，我并不想要，我已经有太多了。我告诉他，我只想要那个女孩。一阵抽气声响起，周围的人等着看我被击倒。我毫不在意，我已过半生，看尽了世间景象。我厌倦了战争，厌倦了侍奉这个嗜战成性的、危险的主人，他只热爱战争和杀戮，没有其他。我知道他的战争里充满了某种疯狂。征服是不够的，他想要的是彻底的毁灭，敌人要一个不留地被屠杀殆尽。他想杀了我，但他离不开战争，自己却无法策划战役、攻城略地，这一切都需要我去完成。因此，他无法杀我。他既需要我的战争才能，又想要我的命。他投来致命的一瞥，紧紧将我留在身旁，但同时又招呼身边的人靠近。那些人围成了一个阿谀奉承的圈子，唯一的缺口便是我站立的地方。一个矮小的人溜进来，从我手臂下钻过去，抬起一张长鼻子的脸，像一只准备撕咬的恶狗，向主人卑躬屈膝，向我咆哮。圈子终于闭合了。但我仍然能看到那闪烁着蓝光的戒指，看到那不安分的双手的比划动作，长长的、苍白的手指和尖尖的指甲。手指以一种奇怪的方式内弯，像是掐死人的手，蓝色的宝石被弯曲的骨头固定着。命令被低声下达，我听不见。早些时候，他夸赞了我的技艺和勇气，并许诺了我丰厚的奖励，说我是他的贵宾。我非常了解他，可以想象他现在为我安排的会是什么样的奖励。我已经准备好了我的表情。

Six guards brought her to him, bundled up in a soldier’s cloak. These men had been taught a trick of grasping that left no bruises. I had never learned it, did not see now how it was done. There was a moment’s pause. I wondered if, after all, generosity might be shown . . . in the circumstances, it seemed just possible.  
六名卫兵将她带到他面前，用一件士兵的斗篷裹住她。这些人被训练过，懂得一种抓握技巧，不会留下任何瘀痕。我从未学过这种技巧，现在也看不出他们是怎么做到的。停顿了一会儿，我在想，或许最终会有一点仁慈……在这样的情况下，这似乎是有可能的。

Then I saw his hand move toward her, the curved predatory fingers, the blazing blue. She gave a small choked cry as the huge ring tore through her hair: it was the one time I heard her voice. I heard too the faint clank of the metal rings round her wrists and ankles when she fell with violence across his knees. I stood motionless, looking on with an expressionless face. That cold, hard, mad, murderous man; her soft young girl’s body and dreaming eyes . . . a pity, sad . . .  
接着，我看到他的手朝她伸去，弯曲如捕食者的手指，闪耀着蓝光。她发出一声低低的窒息般的哭泣，巨大的戒指撕裂了她的头发，这是我唯一一次听到她的声音。我也听到了她摔倒在他膝盖上时，手腕和脚踝上的金属环发出的轻微撞击声。我一动不动地站着，面无表情地看着。那冷酷、冷硬、疯狂、杀气腾腾的男人；她那柔嫩的少女身体和梦幻的双眼……真是可惜，悲哀……

I had decided to approach one of the servants who were still busy round the long tables. I was watching a scared-looking peasant girl, one of the youngest of them, slow, clumsy and obviously new to the work. She seemed frightened, downtrodden, the others teased her, slapped her, jeered, called her half-witted. She was tearful, kept making mistakes, I saw her drop things several times. Her sight could have been defective. I went and stood in a doorway she had to pass, grabbed her and dragged her through, my hand over her mouth. Luckily, the passage beyond was empty. While I was saying I would not harm her, only wanted her help, she looked at me in horror, her red eyes filling with tears; blinked, trembled, seemed too stupid to understand. There was no time, in a moment people would come looking for her, but she would not speak. I spoke to her kindly; argued with her; shook her; showed her a wad of notes. Absolutely no response, no reaction. Increasing the amount of money, I held it under her nose, told her: “Here’s your chance to get away from people who treat you badly. With this you won’t have to work again for a long time.” Finally she saw the point, agreed to take me to the room.  
我决定向那些仍在长桌边忙碌的仆人中的一个寻求帮助。我注意到一个面带惊恐的农家女孩，她是其中最年轻的一个，动作迟缓，笨拙，显然对这项工作很陌生。她看起来很害怕，畏畏缩缩，其他人取笑她，打她，嘲弄她，称她为半疯子。她满眼泪水，不断出错，我看到她好几次摔东西。她的视力可能有问题。我站在她必经的一扇门旁，抓住她，捂住她的嘴，将她拖了过去。幸运的是，外面的走廊是空的。我一边说不会伤害她，只是想要她的帮助，她一边用恐惧的眼神看着我，红肿的眼睛里满是泪水；她眨着眼睛，颤抖着，似乎太迟钝了，不明白我的意思。时间紧迫，再过一会儿就会有人来找她了，但她不肯说话。我对她和气地说；劝说她；摇晃她；给她看一叠钞票。她完全没有反应。我增加了金额，把钱放到她鼻子底下，对她说：“这是你摆脱那些对你不好的人，过上悠闲生活的机会。有了这些钱，你很久都不用再工作了。”她终于明白了，答应带我去那个房间。

We started off, but she was slow and kept hesitating, so that I began to wonder whether she really knew the way. My nerves were on edge, I wanted to hit her, it was hard to control myself. I was afraid of being too late. I said I had to speak to the warden, which would be impossible once the party had started. It was a relief to hear that he never appeared during the early part of the evening, but only when the eating and drinking were over, in about two hours’ time. At last I recognized the final steep staircase. She pointed to the top, clutched the money I was holding ready for her, bolted back the way we had come.  
我们出发了，但她步伐迟缓，不断犹豫不决，我开始怀疑她是否真的知道路。我的神经紧张得像一根绷紧的弦，想要打她，几乎无法控制自己。我担心会来不及。我告诉她，我必须见到管理员，一旦宴会开始这将变得不可能。听到他从不在傍晚早些时候露面，而是要等到吃喝结束，大约两个小时后才会出现，这让我松了一口气。终于，我认出了最后的那段陡峭楼梯。她指向楼梯的顶端，抓住我早已准备好的钱，飞快地跑回了我们来的方向。

I went up and opened the solitary door. The soundproof room was in darkness, but a little of the faint light from the landing came in behind me. I saw the girl lying on the bed, fully dressed, with a book beside her; she had fallen asleep while reading. I spoke her name softly. She started up, her hair glinting. “Who’s that?” There was fear in her voice. I moved, let the dim light touch my face; she knew me at once, said: “What are you doing here?” I said: “You’re in danger; I’ve come to take you away.” “Why should I go with you?” She sounded astonished. “There’s no difference—” We both heard a sound at the same moment; footsteps were starting to mount the stairs. I stepped back, froze, held my breath. The feeble light outside the door was extinguished. I stood in black shadow, I was pretty safe; unless she gave me away.  
我走上前，打开那唯一的一扇门。隔音的房间里一片黑暗，但一点微弱的光从楼梯间透了进来。我看见女孩躺在床上，穿戴整齐，身旁放着一本书；她是在阅读中睡着的。我轻声唤她的名字。她突然惊起，头发在微光下闪烁。“谁在那里？”她的声音里充满了恐惧。我稍微挪动了一下身体，让昏暗的光线照在我的脸上；她立刻认出了我，说：“你怎么会在这里？”我说：“你有危险，我是来带你离开的。”“为什么我要跟你走？”她语气中充满了惊讶。“有什么不同——”我们同时听到一个声音，脚步声正开始爬上楼梯。我退后一步，僵住了，屏住呼吸。门外微弱的光线消失了。我站在黑暗的阴影中，基本上是安全的，除非她把我出卖了。

The man’s ungentle hands gripped her. “Put on your outdoor things quickly. We’re leaving at once.” His voice was low and peremptory. “Leaving?” She stared, saw him as a blacker shadow against the black, her cold lips murmuring: “Why?” “Don’t talk. Do as I tell you.” Obediently she stood up, the draught from the door made her shiver. “How am I supposed to find anything in the dark? Can’t we have a light?” “No. Somebody might see.” He flashed a torch briefly, saw her pick up a comb and start pulling it through her hair, snatched it away from her. “Leave that! Get your coat on—hurry!” The irritable impatience radiating from him made her movements slower, more awkward. Feeling about the dark room, she found her coat but could not find the way into it; she held it the wrong way round. He seized it angrily, turned it, forced her arms through the sleeves. “And now come on! Don’t make a sound. Nobody must know we’ve gone.” “Where are we going? Why do we have to go at this time of night?” She expected no answer, doubted whether she heard correctly when he muttered, “It’s the one chance,” adding something about the approaching ice. He grasped her arm then, pulled her across the landing and on to the stairs. The beam of the torch, intermittently stabbing pitch blackness, showed his looming repressive shadow, which she followed as if sleepwalking through all the ramifications of the huge building, out into the icy snow-filled night.  
男人粗暴地抓住她，“快穿上你的外套，我们马上离开。”他的声音低沉而强硬。“离开？”她瞪大眼睛，看见他像黑暗中更深的一团影子，冰冷的嘴唇颤抖着：“为什么？”“别说话，按我说的做。”她顺从地站了起来，门缝透进来的冷风让她不禁打了个寒战。“我在黑暗中怎么找东西？我们能开灯吗？”“不能。有人会看到。”他迅速闪了一下手电筒，看见她拿起一把梳子开始梳头，立刻将它夺了过去。“别管那个！快穿上你的外套——快点！”他身上散发出的焦躁让她的动作更加迟缓、笨拙。她在黑暗的房间里摸索，找到了外套，但却不知道怎么穿进去；她拿反了方向。他愤怒地抓住外套，给她翻正，强行把她的胳膊塞进袖子里。“现在走！别出声。没人可以知道我们走了。”她问：“我们去哪儿？为什么要在这个时候走？”她并没有期待得到回答，几乎没有听清他低声嘟囔，“这是唯一的机会，”还说了些关于冰雪逼近的话。他紧紧抓住她的胳膊，把她拉过走廊，走向楼梯。手电筒的光束间歇性地刺破漆黑，照亮了他压抑的影子，她像梦游一般跟着他，穿过这座庞大建筑的复杂走道，走进了冰冷的雪夜。

Although snow was falling heavily, there was none on the black car; it had just been cleared away: yet no one had passed them, nobody was in sight. She shivered as she got in, sat in silence while he quickly inspected the chains. Yellow oblongs stained the pure white in front of the windows. In the air, the snow was transformed into showering gold as it passed the lights. A confused noise from the dining hall, voices, clattering plates, drowned the noise of the car starting up, and impelled her to ask: “What about all those people who are expecting you? Aren’t you going to see them?”  
尽管雪下得很大，但黑色的汽车上没有积雪；刚刚被清理干净：然而没有人从他们身边经过，周围也看不到一个人影。她打了个寒战，上车后默不作声地坐着，而他迅速检查着车链。黄色的长方形光斑把窗外的白雪染成一片污迹。空气中，雪花经过灯光时变成了洒落的金粉。餐厅里传来一阵嘈杂的声音，交谈声和盘子碰撞声淹没了发动汽车的响声，这促使她问道：“那些在等你的人怎么办？你不打算见他们吗？”

Already in a state of irritable nervous tension, he was exasperated by the question, lifted one hand from the wheel in a threatening gesture. “I told you not to talk!” His voice was frightening, his eyes flashed in the dark interior of the car. She moved fast to avoid the blow, but could not get out of reach, crouched down, shielding herself with her raised arm, made no sound when the glancing blow struck her shoulder and crushed her against the door; afterward huddled there in silence, shrinking away from his silent rage.  
他本就处于烦躁不安的状态，对她的问题更加恼火，抬起一只手离开方向盘，做出威胁的动作。“我告诉你不要说话！”他的话音吓人，黑暗的车内，他的眼睛闪烁着怒火。她迅速躲避，却无法完全避开，蜷缩着，用高举的手臂护住自己，没有发出任何声音，斜击打在她的肩膀上，把她撞到车门上；之后她就蜷缩在那儿，默不作声，远离他的无声怒火。

Snow-muffled silence outside; silence filling the car. He drove without lights, his eyes like cats’ eyes, able to see through the snowy darkness. A ghost-car, invisible, silent, fled from the ruined town. The ancient snow-covered fortifications fell back and vanished in snow, the broken wall vanished behind. In front loomed the black living wall of the forest, ghostly whiteness fuming along its crest like spray blown back from the crest of a breaking wave. She waited for the black mass to come crashing down on them, but there was no crash, only the silence of snow and forest outside, and in the car, his silence, her apprehension. He never spoke, never looked at her, handled the powerful car recklessly on the rough frozen track, hurling it at speed over all obstacles, as if by the force of his will. The violent lurching of the car threw her about; she was not heavy enough to keep in her seat. Thrown against him, forced to touch his coat, she winced away as though the material burned. He seemed unaware. She felt forgotten, forsaken.  
雪覆盖的寂静笼罩着外面；车内也是一片寂静。他不开灯驾驶，眼睛如猫眼般，在雪夜中洞悉一切。一辆幽灵般的车，隐形无声地逃离废墟般的城镇。古老的雪覆城墙逐渐消失在雪中，破损的城墙消失在身后。前方隐约可见的是黑暗的森林，树冠上弥漫着幽灵般的白雾，像浪峰被风吹回的喷雾。她等待着黑色的墙体轰然倒下，但没有任何轰鸣声，只有雪与森林的寂静，以及车内的他沉默不语，她心中充满不安。他从未开口，也未看她一眼，鲁莽地操控着强劲的车，在崎岖冰冻的道路上高速疾驰，越过一切障碍，仿佛凭借着他的意志力。车的剧烈颠簸使她东倒西歪，她的身体太轻，无法在座位上稳住。被抛向他，迫不得已触碰到他的外套，她如触电般缩了回去，仿佛那布料灼烧了她。他似乎没有察觉。她感到被遗忘，被抛弃。

It was incomprehensible to her, this extraordinary flight that went on and on. The forest went on for ever. The silence went on and on. The snow stopped, but the cold went on and even increased, as if some icy exudation from the black trees congealed beneath them. Hour after hour passed before a little reluctant daylight filtered down through the roof of branches, revealing nothing but gloomy masses of firs, dead and living trees tangled together, a dead bird often caught in the branches, as if the tree had caught it deliberately. She shuddered, identifying herself, as a victim, with the dead bird. It was she who had been snared by nets of black branches. Armies of trees surrounded her on all sides, marching to infinity in all directions. Snow flew past the window again, waving white flags. She was the one who long ago had surrendered. She understood nothing of what was happening. The car leaped in the air, she was flung painfully on to her bruised shoulder, tried ineffectually to shield it with the other hand.  
这一漫无止境的逃亡令她难以理解。森林似乎无边无际，寂静绵延不绝。尽管雪已经停止，但寒冷依然继续，甚至愈加深沉，仿佛黑暗的树木在下方凝结成一股冰冷的气息。一个小时又一个小时过去，直到一缕微弱而不情愿的曙光透过树冠洒落下来，露出阴郁的冷杉森林，死去和活着的树木纠缠在一起，枝头常常挂着一只死鸟，仿佛树枝有意将其捕获。她不禁打了个冷战，将自己与那只死鸟联系起来，觉得自己也是被黑色枝桠网捕获的受害者。成千上万的树木从四面八方包围了她，像是无穷无尽地行军。雪再次飞舞过车窗，仿佛挥舞着白色的旗帜。她早已在这无尽的寒冷中投降，对眼前发生的一切毫无所知。车子猛然一跳，她被剧烈地甩向那受伤的肩膀，疼痛袭来，她徒劳地试图用另一只手去护住。

The man drove the car brutally throughout the short day. It seemed to her that she had never known anything but this terrifying drive in the feeble half-light; the silence, the cold, the snow, the arrogant figure beside her. His cold statue’s eyes were the eyes of a Mercury, ice-eyes, mesmeric and menacing. She wished for hatred. It would have been easier. The trees receded a little, a little more sky appeared, bringing the last gleams of the fading light. Suddenly, she was astonished to see two log huts, a gate between, blocking the road. Unless the gate was opened they could not pass. She watched it racing toward them, reinforced with barbed wire and metal. The car burst through with a tremendous shattering smash, a great rending and tearing, a frantic metallic screeching. Broken glass showered her, she ducked instinctively as a long, sharp, pointed sliver sliced the air just over her head, and the car rocked sickeningly on two wheels before turning over. At the last moment then, by some miracle of skill, or strength, or sheer willpower, the driver brought it back on to its axis again, and drove on as if nothing had happened.  
这个男人在短暂的白昼中残忍地驾驶着汽车。在她看来，仿佛她从未经历过其他任何事情，只有这令人恐惧的驾驶，昏暗的半光，寂静，寒冷，雪花，还有身边这傲慢的身影。他那冰冷如雕像般的眼睛，仿佛是墨丘利的眼睛，冰冷、催眠且充满威胁。她希望能感受到仇恨，那样会更容易些。树木渐渐退后，天空显露出一点光亮，带来了最后几缕将逝的光辉。突然，她惊讶地看到前方路上出现了两座木屋，中间有一道栅栏挡住了去路。如果不打开栅栏，他们就无法通过。她看着它飞速逼近，栅栏上布满铁丝网和金属。汽车以巨大的冲击力撞了上去，传来震耳欲聋的撞击声、撕裂声和疯狂的金属刮擦声。破碎的玻璃如雨点般洒落在她身上，她本能地低头闪避，一块长而尖的碎片从她头顶呼啸而过，汽车在两侧轮子上摇摇欲坠，几乎翻覆。就在最后一刻，凭借着某种奇迹般的技巧、力量，或是纯粹的意志力，司机硬是把车子拉回了轴线上，然后若无其事地继续驾驶下去，仿佛什么都没发生过。

Shouts exploded behind them. A few shots popped ineffectively and fell short. She glanced back and saw uniforms running; then the small commotion was over, cut off by black trees. The road improved on this side of the frontier, the car traveled faster, more smoothly. She shifted her position, leaning away from the stream of ice-vapor entering through the smashed window, shook bits of broken glass off her lap. There was blood on her wrists, both hands were cut and bleeding; she looked at them in remote surprise.  
身后传来爆炸般的叫喊声，几声枪响毫无效果，子弹无力地落在远处。她回头看了一眼，看到一群穿制服的人在奔跑，然后这小小的骚动就被黑暗的树木隔断了。越过边境后，路况改善了许多，汽车行驶得更快、更平稳。她调整了自己的姿势，身体尽量远离从破碎车窗灌进的冰冷气流，抖掉膝盖上的玻璃碎片。她的手腕上有血，两只手都被割伤了，鲜血流淌着。她遥远地看着自己的手，仿佛对眼前的景象感到意外。

I raced down stairs and passages. In sight of the main door I hid in the shadows, watched the men guarding it. Sounds of the party, now growing more animated, came from the dining hall, where drinking was evidently in full swing. Someone shouted to the guards out in the cold corridor. The men I was watching put their heads together, then left their post, passed close to me as they went to join the rest. Unnoticed by anyone, I slipped out through the door they were supposed to be guarding.  
我飞奔下楼，穿过走廊。当看到大门时，我躲在阴影中，观察守卫在那里的人。宴会的声音传来，显然饮酒正进入高潮，气氛也愈加热闹。有人在冰冷的走廊里向守卫们喊话，我正盯着的那几个人凑在一起商量了几句，然后离开了岗位，经过我身边，去和其他人会合。趁无人注意，我悄悄地溜出了他们应该守卫的大门。

It was snowing hard. I could barely distinguish the nearest ruins, white stationary shadows beyond the moving fabric of falling white. Snowflakes turned yellow like swarms of bees round the lighted windows. A wide expanse of snow lay in front of me, a hollow marking the place where the warden’s black car had stood. I realized that various white mounds must be other cars, belonging, presumably, to his household, and waded toward them through the deep snow. I tried the door of the first one, found it unlocked. The whole vehicle was buried in snow, which had drifted deep against wheels and windscreen. Snow fell all over me when I opened the door, filled my sleeve as I tried to clean the glass. I thought the starter would never work, but at last the car began to move slowly forward. I revved the engine just enough to keep the tires gripping, and followed the warden’s hardly visible tracks, which were rapidly being obliterated by fresh snow. Outside the encircling wall they practically vanished. I lost them altogether at the edge of the forest, blindly drove into a tree, scraping off the bark. The car stopped and refused to move. The wheels just spun round, uselessly churning the snow. As I got out, a mass of snow fell on me from the branches above. In two seconds my clothes were caked solid with driving snow. I tore down fir branches, threw them under the wheel, got back into the car and restarted. It was no good; the tires would not grip, still went on spinning and hissing. I was sliding sideways, I pulled on the brake, jumped straight into a snowdrift, sank up to my armpits. The snow kept collapsing on me as I moved, slipped inside my collar, my shirt, I felt snow in my navel; to struggle out was an exhausting business. After breaking off more branches and piling them under the car without the least effect, I knew I was beaten and would have to give up. Weather conditions were quite impossible. Somehow or other I got the car going, and crawled back to the town. It was the only thing to do in the circumstances.  
外面雪下得很大，我几乎无法分辨最近的废墟，白色的静止阴影掩映在移动的白雪幕布后。雪花在亮着灯的窗前变成黄色，像一群群蜜蜂在飞舞。眼前是一片宽阔的雪地，凹陷处标示着管理员的黑色汽车曾经停过的地方。我意识到这些白色的丘状物应该是其他汽车，大概属于管理员的仆从。我艰难地踏着深雪向这些汽车走去，试了试第一辆车的门，发现没有上锁。整辆车都被雪覆盖了，雪在轮胎和挡风玻璃上堆积得很厚。我打开车门时，雪纷纷落在我身上，袖子里也灌满了雪，我尝试擦干净玻璃。起动器似乎永远不会启动，但最后车子终于缓慢前行。我小心地加油，确保轮胎能抓住地面，沿着管理员车子几乎被新雪掩埋的车辙行驶。绕过围墙时，车辙几乎完全消失了，在森林边缘彻底迷失了方向，我盲目地开车撞上了一棵树，刮掉了树皮。车停了下来，再也不动了，轮子在雪中徒劳地打转。我下车时，树枝上的一大团雪砸在我身上，瞬间我的衣服被雪覆盖得结结实实。我折下松树枝，扔到车轮下，重新发动了汽车，但没有用，轮胎抓不住地，继续在雪中打滑发出嘶嘶声。我车身开始侧滑，我拉上刹车，直接跳进了一个雪堆，深陷到腋下。雪不断塌陷，灌进我的领子和衬衫里，我甚至感觉到雪到了肚脐。挣脱出来耗尽了我的体力。我折下更多的树枝，堆在车下，依然无济于事。我知道自己被击败了，只能放弃。在这种天气条件下继续前行是不可能的。不知怎么的，我重新启动了汽车，慢慢开回了城里。在当时的情况下，这已经是唯一能做的事了。

I started skidding again just as I reached the wall, lost control this time. Suddenly I saw the front wheels crumbling the edge of a deep bomb-crater; one more second, and I would be over; the drop was of many feet. I stood on the foot brake, the car spun right round, executed a complete circle before I jumped out and it nosedived, vanishing under the snow.  
当我刚到围墙附近时，车又开始打滑，这次彻底失控了。突然，我看到前轮碾压着一个深深的弹坑边缘，再有一秒钟我就会掉下去了，那可是好几英尺的深坑。我紧急踩下脚刹，车子原地旋转了一圈，我赶紧跳了出去，车子翻转着鼻子朝下，消失在了厚厚的积雪中。

I was freezing, very tired, shivering so much I could hardly walk. Luckily my lodging was not far off. I slithered and staggered back there, crouched over the stove just as I was, plastered in frozen snow, my teeth chattering. The shivering was so violent I could not unfasten my coat, only succeeded in dragging it off by slow stages. In the same laborious fashion, by prolonged painful effort, I finally got rid of the rest of my freezing clothes, struggled into a dressing-gown. It was then that I saw the cable and ripped open the envelope.  
我冻得厉害，非常疲惫，颤抖得几乎走不动路。幸运的是，我的住所不远。我摇摇晃晃地回到那里，就着火炉蜷缩着身子，整个人都被冻僵的雪粘在身上，牙齿不住打颤。颤抖得厉害，我甚至无法解开外套，只能慢慢地脱下来。用同样费力的方式，经过漫长而痛苦的努力，我最终脱掉了其他冰冷的衣物，艰难地穿上了一件浴袍。就在那时，我看到了电报线，撕开了信封。

My informant reported the crisis due in the next few days. All air and sea services had ceased operating, but arrangements had been made to pick me up by helicopter in the morning. Still holding the flimsy paper, I crawled into bed, went on shivering under the piles of blankets. The warden must have received the news earlier in the day. He had fled to save himself, abandoning his people to their fate. Of course such conduct was highly reprehensible, scandalous: but I did not condemn him. I did not think I would have acted differently in his place. Nothing he could have done would have saved the country. If he had revealed the critical situation a panic would have resulted, the roads would have been jammed, nobody would have escaped. In any case, judging by what I had just experienced, his chance of reaching the frontier was extremely slim.  
我的消息来源报告了接下来几天即将到来的危机。所有的空中和海上服务都已经停止，但已经安排好明早用直升机来接我。我抱着那张脆弱的纸条爬上床，继续在一堆毯子下颤抖。看来监护人当天早些时候已经收到了消息。他为了自己的逃生而逃离，抛弃了他的人民于不顾。当然，这种行为是非常应受谴责的，令人震惊的：但我没有谴责他。我觉得如果换成我，我可能也不会有所不同。无论他做什么都无法挽救国家。如果他透露了危急的情况，会引发恐慌，道路会被堵塞，没有人能逃脱。无论如何，根据我刚刚经历的情况来判断，他能够到达边境的机会是极其渺茫的。
