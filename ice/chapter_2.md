## TWO

I heard that the girl had left home suddenly. No one knew where she was. The husband thought she might have gone abroad. It was only a guess. He had no information. I was agitated and asked endless questions, but no concrete facts emerged. “I know no more than you. She simply vanished, I suppose she’s entitled to go if she wants to—she’s free, white and twenty-one.” He adopted a facetious tone, I could not tell if he was speaking the truth. The police did not suspect foul play. There was no reason to think harm had come to her, or that she had not gone away voluntarily. She was old enough to know her own mind. People were constantly disappearing; hundreds left home and were not seen again, many of them women unhappily married. Her marriage was known to have been breaking up. Almost certainly she was better off now, and only wanted to be left in peace. Further investigation would be resented and lead to more trouble.  
听闻那位姑娘突然离家，杳无音讯。丈夫猜测她可能已经去了国外，这仅是猜测，他并无确切消息。我心烦意乱，追问不休，却得不到任何实质性的答案。“我知道的并不比你多，她就这样消失了。如果她想走，完全有权离开——她是自由的，有主见的成年人。”他说话带着嘲讽的语气，我无法判断他的真诚与否。警方并未怀疑有不正当行为，也没有理由认为她遭遇不测，或者不是自愿离开的。她年纪已足以明辨事理。人们时常消失，数以百计的人离家后杳无音信，其中很多是不幸婚姻的妇女。她的婚姻据说已濒临破裂，几乎可以肯定她现在境况更好，只想图个清静。进一步的调查只会招致反感，引发更多麻烦。

This was a convenient view for them, it excused them from taking action. But I did not accept it. She had been conditioned into obedience since early childhood, her independence destroyed by systematic suppression. I did not believe her capable of taking such a drastic step on her own initiative: I suspected pressure from outside. I wished I could talk to someone who knew her well, but she seemed to have had no close friends.  
这倒是一个方便的说法，可以免除他们采取行动的责任。但我不接受这种说法。她从小就被教育要顺从，自主性早已在系统性的压制下被摧毁。我不相信她有能力主动采取如此极端的行动，我怀疑是受到了外部的压力。我希望能找到一个了解她的人谈谈，但她似乎没有什么亲近的朋友。

The husband came to town on some mysterious business, and I asked him to lunch at my club. We talked for two hours, but in the end I was none the wiser. He persistently treated the whole affair lightly, said he was glad she had gone. “Her neurotic behavior nearly drove me demented. I’d had all I could take. She refused to see a psychiatrist. Finally she walked out on me without a word. No explanation. No warning.” He spoke as if he was the injured party. “She went her own way without considering me, so I’m not worrying about her. She won’t come back, that’s one thing certain.” While he was away from home, I took the opportunity of driving down to the house and going through the things in her room, but found nothing in the way of a clue. There was just the usual collection of pathetic rubbish: a china bird; a broken string of fake pearls; snapshots in an old chocolate box. One of these, in which a lake reflected perfectly her face and her shining hair, I put into my wallet.  
丈夫来镇上处理一些神秘的事务，我便邀请他在我的俱乐部共进午餐。我们交谈了两个小时，但最终我依旧毫无头绪。他始终轻描淡写地对待整件事，说很高兴她离开了。“她的神经质行为几乎把我逼疯了，我已经忍无可忍。她拒绝看精神科医生，最后一声不吭地走了。没有解释，也没有任何预兆。”他说得好像他才是受害者。“她走了自己的路，从来不考虑我，所以我也不担心她。她不会回来了，这是毫无疑问的。”趁他不在家的时候，我抓住机会开车去了他们的房子，翻看了她房间里的东西，但没有找到任何线索。只有一些普通的可怜物件：一只瓷鸟、一串断了的假珍珠、装在旧巧克力盒里的几张照片。其中一张，湖水完美地映照着她的脸庞和闪亮的头发，我把它放进了钱包。

Somehow or other I had to find her; the fact remained. I felt the same compulsive urge that had driven me straight to the country when I first arrived. There was no rational explanation, I could not account for it. It was a sort of craving that had to be satisfied.  
无论如何，我必须找到她，这是无可否认的事实。我感到同样强烈的冲动，正是这种冲动驱使我初来乍到时径直前往乡间。这种感觉无法用理性解释，我无法说明原因。这是一种必须满足的渴望。

I abandoned all my own affairs. From now on my business was to search for her. Nothing else mattered. Certain sources of possible information were still available. Hairdressers. Clerks who kept records of transport bookings. Those fringe characters. I went to the places such people frequented, stood about playing the fruit machines until I saw a chance of speaking. Money helped. So did intuition. No clue was too slender to follow up. The approaching emergency made it all the more urgent to find her quickly. I could not get her out of my head. I had not seen all the things I remembered about her. During my first visit I was in their living-room, talking about the Indris, my favorite subject. The man listened. She went to and fro arranging flowers. On an impulse I said the pair of them resembled the lemurs, both so friendly and charming, and living together so happily here in the trees. He laughed. She looked horrified and ran out through the French window, silvery hair floating behind her, her bare legs flashing pale. The secret, shady garden, hidden away in seclusion and silence, was a pleasant cool retreat from the heat of summer. Then suddenly it was unnaturally, fearfully cold. The masses of dense foliage all around became prison walls, impassable circular green ice-walls, surging toward her; just before they closed in, I caught the terrified glint of her eyes.  
我放弃了自己的一切事务。从现在起，我的任务就是寻找她，其他一切都不再重要。还有一些可能获取信息的来源可用。理发师，记录交通预订的职员，那些边缘人物。我去了这些人常去的地方，站在一旁玩老虎机，等待合适的时机与他们交谈。金钱起了作用，直觉也是如此。任何微不足道的线索我都不放过。即将来临的紧急情况使找到她变得更加迫切。我无法将她从脑海中挥去。我没有看到关于她的所有记忆。在我第一次拜访时，我在他们的客厅里，谈论我最喜欢的印度鼠猴。那个男人在听，而她在来回整理花朵。出于冲动，我说他们俩就像那些狐猴一样，既友好又迷人，生活在这里的树上如此幸福。他笑了，而她却惊恐地看着我，随后跑出了法式窗，银色的头发在身后飘荡，光裸的双腿闪烁着苍白。那个隐蔽的幽静花园，是夏日炎热中一片宜人的凉爽避风港。然而，突然之间，它变得异常、恐怖的冰冷。周围浓密的树叶如同牢固的囚墙，无法逾越的绿色冰墙，向她涌来；就在它们合拢之前，我捕捉到了她眼中那一抹恐惧的闪光。

On a winter day she was in the studio, posing for him in the nude, her arms raised in a graceful position. To hold it for any length of time must have been a strain, I wondered how she managed to keep so still; until I saw the cords attached to her wrists and ankles. The room was cold. There was thick frost on the window panes and snow piled up on the sill outside. He wore the long uniform coat. She was shivering. When she asked, “May I have a rest?” her voice had a pathetic tremor. He frowned, looked at his watch before he put down his palette. “All right. That’ll do for now. You can dress.” He untied her. The cords had left deep red angry rings on the white flesh. Her movements were slow and clumsy from cold, she fumbled awkwardly with buttons, suspenders. This seemed to annoy him, He turned away from her sharply, his face irritable. She kept glancing nervously at him, her mouth was unsteady, her hands would not stop shaking.  
在一个冬日，她在工作室里为他裸体摆姿势，双臂优雅地举起。保持这样的姿势一段时间一定很费劲，我不知道她是如何做到如此静止不动的，直到我看见绑在她手腕和脚踝上的绳索。房间很冷，窗玻璃上结着厚厚的霜，窗台外堆满了雪。他穿着长长的制服大衣，而她在颤抖。当她问道，“我能休息一下吗？”她的声音带着可怜的颤抖。他皱了皱眉，看看手表，然后放下调色板，“好吧，暂时到这里。你可以穿衣服了。”他解开了她的绳子，绳子在她白皙的皮肤上留下了深红色的愤怒痕迹。她因寒冷动作迟缓笨拙，笨手笨脚地处理着纽扣和吊带。这似乎让他很不耐烦，他突然转身，面露恼怒。她紧张地不停瞥向他，嘴唇颤抖不止，双手也抖个不停。

Another time the two were together in a cold room. As usual, he wore the long coat. It was night, freezing hard. He had a book in his hand, she was doing nothing. She looked cold and miserable, huddled up in a thick gray loden coat with a red and blue check lining. The room was silent and full of tension. It could be felt that neither of them had spoken for a long time. Outside the window, a twig snapped in the iron frost with a sound like a handclap. He dropped the book and got up to put on a record. Instantly she began to protest. “Oh, no! Not that awful singing, for heaven’s sake!” He ignored her, went on with what he was doing. The turntable started revolving. It was a record I had given them from my tape recording of the lemurs’ song. To me, the extraordinary jungle music was lovely, mysterious, magical. To her it was a sort of torture, apparently. She covered her ears with her hands, winced at the high notes, looked more and more distraught. When the record ended and he restarted it without a moment’s pause, she cried out as if he had struck her, “No! I won’t listen to it all over again!” threw herself at the mechanism, stopped it so abruptly that the voices expired in uncanny wailing. He faced her angrily. “What the hell do you think you’re doing? Have you gone off your head?” “You know I can’t stand that horrible record.” She seemed almost beside herself. “You only play it because I hate it so much . . .” Tears sprang unchecked from her eyes, she brushed them away carelessly with her hand.  
在一个冬日，她在工作室里为他裸体摆姿势，双臂优雅地举起。保持这样的姿势一段时间一定很费劲，我不知道她是如何做到如此静止不动的，直到我看见绑在她手腕和脚踝上的绳索。房间很冷，窗玻璃上结着厚厚的霜，窗台外堆满了雪。他穿着长长的制服大衣，而她在颤抖。当她问道，“我能休息一下吗？”她的声音带着可怜的颤抖。他皱了皱眉，看看手表，然后放下调色板，“好吧，暂时到这里。你可以穿衣服了。”他解开了她的绳子，绳子在她白皙的皮肤上留下了深红色的愤怒痕迹。她因寒冷动作迟缓笨拙，笨手笨脚地处理着纽扣和吊带。这似乎让他很不耐烦，他突然转身，面露恼怒。她紧张地不停瞥向他，嘴唇颤抖不止，双手也抖个不停。

He glared at her, said: “Why should I sit in silence for hours just because you don’t choose to open your mouth?” His angry voice was full of indignant resentment. “What’s wrong with you, anyhow, these days? Why can’t you behave like a normal being?” She did not answer, dropped her face in her hands. Tears dripped between her fingers. He gazed at her with a disgusted expression. “I might as well be in solitary confinement as alone with you here. But I warn you I’m not going to put up with it much longer. I’ve had enough. I’m sick and tired of the way you’re carrying on. Pull yourself together, or else—” With a threatening scowl, he went out, banging the door behind him. A silence followed, while she stood like a lost child, tears wet on her cheeks. Next she started wandering aimlessly round the room, stopped by the window, pulled the curtain aside, then cried out in amazement.  
他怒视着她，说道：“凭什么我得默默坐上几个小时，只因为你不愿意开口？”他愤怒的声音充满了愤懑不平。“最近你到底怎么了？为什么不能像个正常人一样？”她没有回答，只是双手掩面，泪水从指缝间滴落。他厌恶地看着她。“与其和你在一起，我还不如一个人待着。但我警告你，我不会再忍受多久了。我受够了，厌倦了你这副模样。振作起来，否则——”他带着威胁的怒容走了出去，重重地甩上了门。房间里一片寂静，她像个迷路的孩子一样站在那里，泪水湿透了脸颊。接着，她开始在房间里无目的地徘徊，走到窗前，拉开窗帘，然后惊呼出声。

Instead of the darkness, she faced a stupendous sky-conflagration, an incredible glacial dream-scene. Cold coruscations of rainbow fire pulsed overhead, shot through by shafts of pure incandescence thrown out by mountains of solid ice towering all around. Closer, the trees round the house, sheathed in ice, dripped and sparkled with weird prismatic jewels, reflecting the vivid changing cascades above. Instead of the familiar night sky, the aurora borealis formed a blazing, vibrating roof of intense cold and color, beneath which the earth was trapped with all its inhabitants, walled in by those impassable glittering ice-cliffs. The world had become an arctic prison from which no escape was possible, all its creatures trapped as securely as were the trees, already lifeless inside their deadly resplendent armor.  
映入她眼帘的不是黑暗，而是一片壮丽的天空焰火，一个令人难以置信的冰川梦境。寒冷的彩虹之火在头顶脉动，纯净的光柱穿透四周高耸的坚冰山脉喷射而出。近处，房子周围的树木包裹在冰层中，滴落着奇异的棱镜般的珠宝，映射着上方不断变化的绚烂瀑布。熟悉的夜空消失了，取而代之的是极光形成的炽热、振动的屋顶，散发着强烈的寒冷与色彩，将地球和所有生物困在其中，被那些无法跨越的闪闪发光的冰壁围住。整个世界变成了一座北极监狱，无法逃脱，所有的生物都被牢牢困住，像那些已经在致命的光辉盔甲中失去生命的树木一样。

Despairingly she looked all around. She was completely encircled by the tremendous ice walls, which were made fluid by explosions of blinding light, so that they moved and changed with a continuous liquid motion, advancing in torrents of ice, avalanches as big as oceans, flooding everywhere over the doomed world. Wherever she looked, she saw the same fearful encirclement, soaring battlements of ice, an overhanging ring of frigid, fiery, colossal waves about to collapse upon her. Frozen by the deathly cold emanating from the ice, dazzled by the blaze of crystalline ice-light, she felt herself becoming part of the polar vision, her structure becoming one with the structure of ice and snow. As her fate, she accepted the world of ice, shining, shimmering, dead; she resigned herself to the triumph of glaciers and the death of her world.  
她绝望地四处张望，看到自己被巨大的冰墙完全包围。这些冰墙因刺眼的光芒爆发而变得如液体般流动，不断地以液态运动变换，冰川如同汹涌的海洋般向前推进，巨大的雪崩淹没了注定灭亡的世界。无论她望向何处，都看到同样令人恐惧的包围，冰雪的堡垒高耸入云，冰冷而炽热的巨大波浪即将倾泻而下，环绕在她的四周。被冰的致命寒气冻住，被晶莹的冰光刺得目眩，她感觉自己逐渐融入这极地幻境，身体的结构仿佛与冰雪的结构合为一体。她接受了冰雪世界的命运，闪耀、颤动、死寂；她顺从地接受了冰川的胜利和她世界的毁灭。

It was essential for me to find her without delay. The situation was alarming, the atmosphere tense, the emergency imminent. There was talk of a secret act of aggression by some foreign power, but no one knew what had actually happened. The government would not disclose the facts. I was informed privately of a steep rise in radioactive pollution, pointing to the explosion of a nuclear device, but of an unknown type, the consequences of which could not be accurately predicted. It was possible that polar modifications had resulted, and would lead to a substantial climatic change due to the refraction of solar heat. If the melting Antarctic ice cap flowed over the South Pacific and Atlantic oceans, a vast ice-mass would be created, reflecting the sun’s rays and throwing them back into outer space, thus depriving the earth of warmth. In town, everything was chaotic and contradictory. News from abroad was censored, but travel was left unrestricted. Confusion was increased by a spate of new and conflicting regulations, and by the arbitrary way controls were imposed or lifted. The one thing that would have clarified the position was an overall picture of world events; but this was prohibited by the determination of the politicians to ban all foreign news. My impression was that they had lost their heads, did not know how to deal with the approaching danger, and hoped to keep the public in ignorance of its exact nature until a plan had been evolved.  
我必须立即找到她。局势令人不安，气氛紧张，紧急情况迫在眉睫。有人说有某个外国势力在进行秘密侵略行动，但没有人知道究竟发生了什么。政府拒绝透露事实。我私下得知，放射性污染急剧上升，指向某种未知类型的核装置爆炸，其后果无法准确预测。极地可能发生了变化，并可能导致由于太阳热量折射而引发的重大气候变化。如果南极冰盖融化并流入南太平洋和大西洋，将形成一个巨大的冰块，反射太阳光并将其重新投射到外太空，从而使地球失去温暖。城镇里一片混乱和矛盾。来自国外的消息被审查，但旅行却没有限制。新出台的大量矛盾法规以及控制措施的随意实施或解除，进一步加剧了混乱。唯一能够澄清局势的，就是了解世界事件的整体情况；但政客们决定禁止一切外部消息，阻止了这一点。我感觉他们已经失去了理智，不知道如何应对即将到来的危险，并希望在制定出计划之前，让公众对其具体性质一无所知。

No doubt people would have been more concerned, and would have made greater efforts to find out what was taking place in other countries, if, at home, they had not been obliged to contend with the fuel shortage, the power cuts, the breakdown of transport, and the rapid diversion of supplies to the black market.  
毫无疑问，如果不是国内人们必须应对燃料短缺、停电、交通瘫痪以及物资迅速流入黑市的情况，他们会更加关注并且更加努力了解其他国家发生了什么。

There was no sign of a break in the abnormal cold. My room was reasonably warm, but even in hotels heating was being reduced to a minimum, and, outside, the erratic, restricted services hampered my investigations. The river had been frozen over for weeks, the total paralysis of the docks was a serious problem. All essential commodities were in short supply; rationing, at least of fuel and food, could not be delayed much longer, despite the reluctance of those in power to resort to unpopular measures.  
异常的寒冷丝毫没有缓解的迹象。我的房间还算暖和，但即便是在酒店，供暖也已被降至最低水平。外面，混乱而有限的服务阻碍了我的调查。河流已经冻结了数周，港口的全面瘫痪是一个严重的问题。所有必需品都供应不足；尽管当权者不愿采取不受欢迎的措施，但燃料和食物的配给已经不能再拖延了。

Everyone who could do so was leaving in search of better conditions. No more passages were available, either by sea or air; there were long waiting lists for all ships and planes. I had no proof that the girl was already abroad. On the whole it seemed unlikely she would have managed to leave the country, and an obscure train of thought suggested that she might embark on a certain vessel.  
每一个能够离开寻找更好条件的人都在离开。无论是海上还是空中，都没有可用的航班；所有船只和飞机的等候名单都很长。我没有证据证明那女孩已经出国。总的来说，她可能还没有离开国家，而一种隐晦的思路暗示她可能会登上某艘特定的船只。

The port was a long way off, to reach it involved a long complicated journey. I was delayed, got there, after traveling all night, only an hour before sailing time. The passengers were already aboard, crowding the decks with friends who were seeing them off. The first thing I had to do was to speak to the captain. He turned out to be maddeningly talkative. While I became more and more impatient, he complained at great length about the way the authorities allowed overcrowding: it was a danger to his ship, unfair to himself, to the company, the passengers, the insurance people. That was his business. As soon as I got permission to get on with my own, I made a methodical search of the ship, but without finding a trace of the person I wanted.  
港口离这里很远，到达那里需要一段漫长而复杂的旅程。我因此耽搁了，整夜旅行后，在开航前仅有一个小时才赶到。乘客已经登船，甲板上挤满了为他们送行的朋友。我首先需要与船长交谈。结果他说话起来非常啰嗦。而我越来越不耐烦时，他则长篇大论地抱怨当局允许过度拥挤：这对他的船只是一种危险，对他个人、公司、乘客和保险公司都是不公平的。这是他的事务。一旦我获得继续自己事务的许可，我对船进行了有条不紊的搜索，但没有找到我想要的人的任何踪迹。

Finally I gave up in despair and went out on deck. Too tired and disheartened to push through the crowds of people milling about there, I stood by the rail, overcome by a sudden urge to abandon the whole affair. I had never really had a valid reason for supposing the girl would be on this ship. Suddenly it seemed neither sensible, nor even sane, to continue search based solely on vague surmise; particularly as my attitude to its object was so undefined. When I considered that imperative need I felt for her, as for a missing part of myself, it appeared less like love than an inexplicable aberration, the sign of some character flaw I ought to eradicate, instead of letting it dominate me.  
最终我绝望地放弃了，走到甲板上。我太疲惫和沮丧，无法穿过围绕在那里的人群，站在栏杆旁，突然产生了放弃整个事务的冲动。我从来没有真正有过一个确凿的理由认为那女孩会在这艘船上。突然间，继续基于模糊猜测进行搜索既不明智，甚至不理智；特别是因为我对她的态度如此模糊不清。当我考虑到我对她的这种迫切需要，就像我自己失落的一部分，这种感觉似乎不像是爱情，而更像是一种无法解释的异常，显示出我应该根除的一些性格缺陷，而不是让它主导我的生活。

At this moment a big black-backed gull sailed past, almost brushing my cheek with its wing tip, as if on purpose to draw my attention and eyes after it up to the boat deck. At once I saw her there, looking away from me, where no one had been before; and everything I had just been thinking was swept out of my head by a wave of excitement, my old craving for her returned. I was convinced it was she without even seeing her face; no other girl in the world had such dazzling hair, or was so thin that her fragility could be seen through a thick gray coat. I simply had to reach her, it was all I could think of. Envying the gull’s effortless flight, I plunged straight into the solid mass of humanity separating me from her, and forced my way through. I had hardly any time, in a moment the boat would be sailing. Visitors were leaving already, forming a strong cross current I had to fight. My one idea was to get to the boat deck before it was too late. In my anxiety, I must have pushed people aside. Hostile remarks were made, a fist shaken. I tried to explain my urgency to those who obstructed me, but they would not listen. Three tough-looking young men linked arms and aggressively barred my way, their expressions threatening. I had not meant to offend, hardly knew what I was doing. I was thinking only of her. Suddenly an official voice shouted through a loudspeaker: “All visitors ashore! The gangway will be raised in exactly two minutes.” The ship’s siren sounded an ear-splitting blast. An immediate rush followed. It was quite impossible to resist the human flood surging toward the gangway. I was caught up in the stampede, dragged along with it, off the boat, and on to the quay.  
就在这时，一只大型黑背鸥飞过，几乎用翅膀尖端划过我的面颊，仿佛特意引起我的注意，我顺着它的目光望向船板上。立刻我看到了她，她背对着我，之前那里还空无一人；我刚刚所思所想顿时被一阵激动冲走，我对她的旧有渴望再次袭来。我深信那就是她，甚至还未见她的面容；世界上没有其他女孩拥有如此耀眼的头发，或是如此纤瘦，以至于她在厚厚的灰色外套下的脆弱也能透露出来。我必须赶过去，这是我唯一的想法。羡慕那只鸥毫不费力的飞行，我直接冲入人群中，强行前行。时间所剩无几，一会儿船就要启航了。游客已经开始离开，形成了一股强劲的逆流，我必须与之抗争。我唯一的念头是在为时已晚之前抵达船板。在我的焦急中，我一定是推开了一些人。有人发表了敌意的言论，有人摇了摇拳头。我试图向阻碍我的人解释我的急迫性，但他们不肯听。三个看起来强壮的年轻人携手阻拦，他们的表情充满威胁。我并非故意冒犯，几乎不知道自己在做什么。我只想着她。突然，一个官方声音通过扩音器喊道：“所有访客请上岸！登船通道将在两分钟后关闭。”船的汽笛发出一声震耳欲聋的响声。立即引发了一阵冲击。根本无法抵挡涌向登船通道的人潮。我被卷入了人群中，被它拖离了船，拉回到了码头。

Standing at the water’s edge, I soon saw her high above me, considerably further off now. The ship had already moved away from the shore and was gathering speed every second, already divided from me by a strip of water too wide to jump. In desperation, I shouted and waved my arms, trying to attract her attention. It was hopeless. A whole sea of arms waved all around me, innumerable voices were shouting unintelligibly. I saw her turn to speak to somebody who had just joined her, at the same time pulling a hood over her head, so that her hair was hidden. Immediate doubts invaded me, and increased as I watched her. After all, perhaps she was not the right girl; she seemed too self-possessed. But I was not certain.  
站在水边，我很快就看到她高高在上，离我已经相当远了。船已经离开岸边，每秒钟都在加速，已经被一条无法跃过的水面隔开了。我绝望地大声喊叫，挥动着双臂，试图吸引她的注意。但是无济于事。周围一片手臂在挥动，无数声音在不可理解地喊叫。我看到她转身和一个刚刚加入她的人说话，同时把头巾拉过头，把头发遮住了。立刻，怀疑涌上心头，并且随着我看着她而增加。毕竟，也许她并不是那个正确的女孩；她看起来太沉着了。但我并不确定。

The boat was now beginning the turn that would bring it round facing the mouth of the harbor, leaving behind it a curving track of smoother water, like the swath left by a scythe. I stood staring after it, although cold had driven the passengers off the decks and there was no more hope of recognition. I dimly remembered what I had been thinking just before I caught sight of her, but only as one might recall an incident from a dream. Once again the urgency of the search had reclaimed me; I was totally absorbed in that obsessional need, as for a lost, essential portion of my own being. Everything else in the world seemed immaterial.  
船现在开始转向，面对港口的入口，留下一条弯曲的水痕，如同镰刀留下的收割线。我站在那里望着它，尽管寒冷已经迫使乘客离开甲板，不再有认出她的希望了。我依稀记得在看到她之前自己在想什么，但那只像是回忆梦中的一幕。搜索的紧迫感再次占据了我，我完全沉浸在那种失落、必要的自我存在的需求中。世界上的一切似乎都变得微不足道起来。

All around me people were walking away, stamping their feet in the cold. I hardly noticed the mass departure. It did not occur to me to leave the edge of the water, over which I continued to gaze at the vessel’s diminishing shape. I had been an utter fool. I was furious with myself for letting it go without discovering the identity of the girl on board. Now I would never be sure whether she had, or had not, been the right one. And if she had been, how would I ever find her again? A mournful hoot traveled across the water: the ship was leaving the protection of the harbor, heading out into the open sea. Already meeting the offshore rollers, it kept disappearing behind gray masses of water surging along the horizon. It looked absurdly small, a toy boat. I lost sight of it, my eyes could not find it again. It was lost irretrievably.  
周围的人们纷纷离开，在寒冷中跺着脚步。我几乎没有注意到这场集体离去。我也没有想过离开水边，继续凝视着船只渐渐变小的形状。我真是个大傻瓜。我对自己放任船只离开、没有发现船上女孩身份感到愤怒。现在我永远不会确定她是否就是那个人了。而如果她就是的话，我又怎么可能再找到她呢？一声悲哀的汽笛声响彻水面：船正在离开港口的保护，驶向开阔的海域。它已经开始与远海的波涛相遇，不断消失在灰色的水浪背后，涌向地平线。它显得荒谬地小，如同一只玩具船。我失去了它，我的眼睛再也找不到它。它已经无法挽回地失去了。

I only became aware that everyone else had gone and that I was alone there, when two policemen approached, marching along side by side, and pointed to a sign, “Loitering on the waterfront strictly forbidden: War Department.” “Why are you hanging about here? Can’t you read?” Needless to say, they refused to believe that I had not seen it. Hugely tall in their helmets, they stood on each side, so close that their guns stuck into me, and demanded my papers. These were in order. There was nothing against me. Nevertheless, my conduct had been suspicious, they insisted on writing down my name and address. Again I had acted stupidly, this time by drawing attention to myself. Now that my name had been noted, it would appear in the records; I would be known to the police everywhere, my movements would be kept under observation. It would be a serious handicap in my search.  
我直到两名警察并排走来，指着一个标志才意识到其他人都已经离开，我独自一人站在那里。“严禁在海滨闲逛：战争部门。”“你为什么在这里逗留？你看不见吗？”不用说，他们不相信我没有看到那个标志。他们头顶高大的头盔，站在我两侧，枪口几乎贴在我身上，要求查看我的证件。我的证件没有问题，没有违法记录。尽管如此，他们认为我的行为可疑，坚持要写下我的姓名和地址。我再次表现得愚蠢，这次是因为吸引了他们的注意。现在我的名字已经被记录下来，将会出现在档案中；警察们会知道我，我的行动会受到监视。这将严重阻碍我的搜索。

As the two men hustled me through the gates, something made me look up at a row of big black-backed gulls perched on a wall, all facing into the wind and pointing out to sea, as motionless as if they had been stuffed and put up there to act as a message. On the spot I decided to leave the country before any of my visas lapsed or were canceled. No particular place seemed more or less promising than another as a base from which to start searching. But to attempt to operate from here while under suspicion would surely invite failure.  
当那两名男子匆匆带我穿过大门时，有些东西让我抬头看向一排栖息在墙上的大型黑背鸥，它们全部面向风，指向大海，一动不动，仿佛被装填好放在那里传达某种信息。我当场决定在我的任何签证到期或被取消之前离开这个国家。没有特定的地方比其他地方更有希望作为开始搜索的基地。但在受到怀疑的情况下尝试在这里行动肯定会导致失败。

I had to leave at once, before the police report circulated. It could not have been done through the normal channels. By employing other methods, I managed to board a northbound cargo boat carrying a few passengers, and booked to the end of the voyage. The purser was willing to vacate his cabin for a consideration. Next day, at the first port of the trip, I went on deck to watch our arrival. I remembered the complaints I had been forced to listen to about overcrowding when I saw a lot of people packed together on the deck below, waiting to disembark. Twelve was the authorized number of passengers. I wondered how many more were on board.  
我必须立即离开，以免警方报告传开。这不可能通过正常渠道完成。通过其他方法，我设法登上了一艘载有少数乘客的北向货船，并预订了整个航程。乘务长愿意为了一些补偿让出他的舱房。第二天，在航程的第一个港口，我走到甲板上观看我们的到达。当我看到下面甲板上挤在一起等待下船的许多人时，我想起了我不得不听取的有关过度拥挤的抱怨。船上的乘客人数是受许可的十二人。我不知道还有多少人在船上。

It was extremely cold. Loose fragments of pack ice drifted past in the green water. Everything was misty and indistinct. The landing-stage was quite close, but the buildings at the end of the jetty looked insubstantial, amorphous. A girl in a heavy gray coat with a hood was standing a little apart from the other passengers, leaning on the rail. Occasionally a fold of the coat would blow back, showing a quilted check lining. It was the coat I noticed; although I knew perfectly well that such coats had become almost a uniform among women since the start of the cold, and were to be seen everywhere.  
天气极其寒冷。零散的浮冰片在绿色的水中漂过。一切都朦胧不清。码头很近，但延伸至码头尽头的建筑物看起来虚无缥缈、无定形。一个穿着厚重灰色大衣和帽子的女孩站在稍微远离其他乘客的地方，倚靠在栏杆上。偶尔，大衣的一角被风吹起，露出格子棉衬里。我注意到了那件大衣；尽管我很清楚，自从天冷以来，这样的大衣几乎成了女性的制服，随处可见。

The mist began to lift and break up, the sun would shine later. A rugged coastline appeared with many inlets and jagged rocks, snow-covered mountains behind. There were many small islands, some of which floated up and became clouds, while formations of cloud or mist descended and anchored themselves in the sea. The white snowy landscape below, and above the canopy of misty white light, the effect of an oriental painting, nothing solid about it. The town appeared to consist of ruins collapsing on one another in shapeless disorder, a town of sandcastles, wrecked by the tide. A great wall which had protected it was broken in many places, both ends subsiding uselessly into the water. The place had once been important. Its fortifications had lain in ruins for centuries. It was still of some historical interest.  
雾气开始散去，阳光即将照耀。一个崎岖的海岸线显现出来，有许多入海口和嶙峋的岩石，背后是雪覆盖的山脉。还有许多小岛，其中一些浮现成云，而云或雾的形态则降落在海面上。在白雪覆盖的景观下方，上方是朦胧的白光天幕，宛如一幅东方画卷，一切都不实在。这个城镇似乎是由于形状混乱而相互崩塌的废墟组成，一个沙堡城镇，被潮水摧毁。曾经保护它的一道长城在许多地方已经破损，两端无用地沉入水中。这个地方曾经很重要，它的防御工事已经废墟了几个世纪。它仍然具有一定的历史意义。

Sudden silence fell. The engines had stopped. The boat was still moving forward under its own momentum. I heard the faint swish of water against the sides, the plangent crying of sea birds, that sad northern sound. Otherwise all was silent. No sounds of traffic, of bells or voices, came from the land. The town of ruins waited in utter silence under the brooding mountains. I thought of long narrow ancient ships, vast collections of loot preserved in barrows, winged helmets, drinking horns, great heavy ornaments of gold and silver, piles of fossilized bones. It looked a place of the past, of the dead.  
突然间，一片寂静降临。引擎停了。船只仍在自身动力下向前移动。我听到微弱的水声拍打船舷的声音，以及海鸟哀鸣的悲伤北方音调。除此之外，一切都是寂静的。没有来自陆地的交通声、钟声或声音。在苍凉的山脉下，这座废墟之城静静等待着。我想到了古老的长条狭窄的船只，保存在墓冢中的大量战利品，有翅膀的头盔、饮酒角、大型的金银装饰品和堆积的化石骨骼。这看起来像是一个过去和死者的地方。

There was a shout from the bridge. On the jetty a group of sullen-faced men rose out of the ground. They were armed and wore uniform: black padded tunics, belted tight at the waist, high boots, fur caps. The knives in their belts caught the light as they moved. They looked outlandish, even menacing. I heard somebody say they were the warden’s men, which meant nothing; I had not heard of this warden. Their presence surprised me since private armies were forbidden by law. Ropes were thrown; they caught them and made them fast. The gangway crashed down. A slight stir started among the passengers, who picked up luggage, got out passports and papers, began a slow shuffling progress toward a barrier that had been set up.  
桥上传来一声喊叫。在码头上，一群愁容满面的男子从地上站了起来。他们全副武装，穿着制服：黑色棉衣，腰间系紧皮带，高筒靴子，毛皮帽子。他们腰间的刀子在移动时反射出光芒。他们看起来古怪而又威胁。我听见有人说他们是典狱长的手下，这对我毫无意义；我从未听说过这位典狱长。他们的出现让我感到惊讶，因为私人军队在法律上是被禁止的。绳索被扔下来；他们抓住并系牢。登船桥轰然落下。乘客中间出现了轻微的骚动，他们拿起行李，取出护照和文件，开始缓慢地向设置好的检查点移动。

Only the girl in the gray coat did not concern herself with landing, did not change her position. As the others moved forward and she was left isolated, my interest increased, I could not detach my attention from her, kept on watching. What most struck me was her complete stillness. Such a passive attitude, suggesting both resistance and resignation, did not seem entirely normal in a young girl. She could not have been more motionless if she had been tied to the rail, and I thought how easily bonds could be hidden by the voluminous coat.  
只有穿灰色外套的女孩并不关心着陆，也没有改变她的位置。当其他人向前移动而她被孤立时，我的兴趣增加了，我无法从她身上移开目光，继续观察着。最让我印象深刻的是她的完全静止。这样一种被动的态度，既显示出抵抗又显得顺从，对于一个年轻女孩来说并不完全正常。她若是被捆绑在栏杆上，也不会更加静止。我想到了那件宽大的外套下隐藏着束缚的容易。

A bright strand of glittering blonde hair, almost white, escaped from the hood and blew loose in the wind; I felt a sudden excitement; but reminded myself that many northerners were extremely fair. All the same, my interest now became compelling, I was longing to see her face. She would have to look up toward me before that could happen.  
一缕明亮的金发，几乎是白色的，在兜帽中飘出，被风吹得松散起来；我突然感到一种兴奋；但提醒自己，许多北方人都极其白皙。尽管如此，我的兴趣现在变得无法抗拒，我渴望看到她的面容。她必须抬头朝我看才能实现这一愿望。

The passengers’ forward movement was interrupted. Men in uniform came aboard and cleared a way through them, demanding room for the warden, shouting peremptory orders. Space was made for a tall man, yellow haired, handsome in a tough, hawk-hard northern fashion, his height jutting above those near him. His arrogant manner, his total disregard for the feelings of others, made an unpleasant impression. As if he sensed my criticism, he glanced up for a second. His eyes were startling pieces of bright blue ice. I saw that he was making for the girl in the gray coat, the one person who had not seen him. Everyone else was staring. When he called out, “Why are you standing there? Have you gone to sleep?” she swung round as if terribly startled. “Hurry up! The car’s waiting.” He went close and touched her. He was smiling, but I detected a hint of a threat in his voice and behavior. She hung back, seemed unwilling to go with him. He linked arms with her, apparently friendly, but really forcing her forward against her will, pulling her along with him through the bunched, staring people. She still did not look up, I could not see her expression, but I could imagine his iron grip on her thin wrist. They left the ship before anyone else, and were immediately driven off in a big black car.  
乘客们向前移动被打断了。穿制服的男人上了船，为看守开路，高声发号施令，要求让路。一个高个子、金发的男人获得了空间，他以一种坚毅而鹰隼般的北方风格显得英俊，身高超过他周围的人。他傲慢的态度，完全不顾他人感受，给人留下了不愉快的印象。仿佛他察觉到我的批评，他抬头看了我一眼。他那双明亮的蓝色眼睛让人惊讶如同冰块。我看到他正朝着穿灰色外套的女孩走去，而她是唯一一个没看见他的人。其他人都在盯着他。当他大声喊道，“你站在那里干什么？睡着了吗？”她像是被惊吓了一样急忙转过身来。“快点！车在等着呢。”他走近她，微笑着，但我察觉到他话语和行为中带着一丝威胁。她略微迟疑了一下，似乎不愿意跟他走。他挽起她的胳膊，看起来友好，但实际上却是迫使她不情愿地向前走，拉着她穿过一群簇拥而视的人群。她仍然没有抬头，我看不到她的表情，但我能想象得到他紧紧抓着她瘦弱手腕的情景。他们比其他人先离开了船，立刻被一辆大黑车接走了。

I had been standing there as if petrified. Suddenly now I made a decision. It seemed worth taking a chance. Although without having seen her face . . . I had no other clue to follow, in any case.  
我一直站在那里，仿佛石化了一般。突然间，我做出了一个决定。看起来值得冒险一试。虽然我还没有见过她的面容……但我没有其他线索可循，无论如何。

I ran down to the cabin, sent for the purser, told him I had changed my plans. “I’m going ashore here.” He looked at me as though I was out of my mind. “Please yourself.” He shrugged his shoulders indifferently, but could not quite conceal an incipient grin. He had already received his money. Now he would be able to collect a second payment from somebody else for the remainder of the voyage.  
我跑下船舱，找来了乘务长，告诉他我改变了计划。“我要在这里下船。”他看着我，仿佛觉得我有些疯狂。“随你便。”他漠不关心地耸了耸肩，但没能完全掩饰住一个初露的笑容。他已经收到了我的钱。现在他能从别人那里再收取一笔费用，以完成余下的航程。

I hurriedly threw into my suitcase the few things I had unpacked.  
我匆忙地把我已经拆开的几件东西扔进了手提箱里。
