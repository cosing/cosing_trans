## SEVEN

The aircraft deposited me at a distant port just before the ship sailed. I was suffering from some kind of fever, shivering, aching, apathetic. I sat at the back of the car rushing me to the docks, did not even look out, went on board in a daze. The ship was already moving when I crossed the deck, meaning to go straight to my cabin. But now the scene caught my eye, and it gave me a shock; I stopped and stood staring. A sunlit harbor was sliding past me, a busy town; I saw wide streets, well-dressed people, modern buildings, cars, yachts on the blue water. No snow; no ruins; no armed guards. It was a miracle, a flashback to something dreamed. Then another shock, the sensation of a violent awakening, as it dawned on me that this was the reality, and those other things the dream. All of a sudden the life I had lately been living appeared unreal: it simply was not credible any longer. I felt a huge relief, it was like emerging into sunshine from a long cold black tunnel. I wanted to forget what had just been happening, to forget the girl and the senseless, frustrating pursuit I had been engaged in, and think only about the future.  
飞机把我送到了一个偏远的港口，就在船启航之前。我那时正在发烧，浑身发抖，疼痛，心情沉闷。我坐在急速赶往码头的车后座，甚至没有看窗外，迷迷糊糊地登上了船。船已经开动了，当我穿过甲板，打算直接去自己的舱房时，眼前的景象突然吸引了我的注意，令我震惊；我停下脚步，愣愣地盯着看。阳光明媚的港口从我身边滑过，繁忙的城镇，宽阔的街道，衣着讲究的人群，现代化的建筑，汽车，蓝色海面上的游艇。没有雪；没有废墟；没有武装警卫。这是一个奇迹，仿佛是梦中回到了一种场景。接着，又是一阵震撼，就像突然惊醒一般，我意识到这才是真实的，那些其他的才是梦境。忽然间，我最近所经历的一切显得不再真实：那种生活再也无法让人信服了。我感到一种巨大的解脱，就像是从一个漫长、冰冷、黑暗的隧道中走出来，沐浴在阳光下。我只想忘记刚刚发生的一切，忘记那个女孩和那无意义的、令人沮丧的追逐，只想着未来。

Later, when the fever left me, my feelings remained unchanged. Thankful to have escaped from the past, I decided to go to the Indris; to make that tropical island my home, and the lemurs themselves my life work. I would devote the rest of my time to studying them, writing their history, recording their strange songs. No one else had done it, as far as I knew. It seemed a satisfactory project, a worthwhile aim.  
后来，当烧退了，我的感受依旧未变。感激能够逃离过去，我决定前往印德里斯岛，把那个热带岛屿当作我的家，把狐猴当作我一生的事业。我将余生奉献给研究它们，撰写它们的历史，记录它们奇特的歌声。据我所知，还没有人做过这件事。这似乎是一个令人满意的计划，一个值得追求的目标。

From the shop on board I bought a big notebook and a stock of ball-point pens. I was ready to plan my work. But I could not concentrate. After all, I had not escaped the past. My thoughts kept wandering back to the girl; incredible that I should have wished to forget her. Such a forgetting would have been monstrous, impossible. She was like a part of me, I could not live without her. But now I wanted to go to the Indris, so there was a conflict. She prevented me, holding me back with thin arms.  
我在船上的商店买了一本大笔记本和一堆圆珠笔，准备开始规划我的工作。然而，我无法集中注意力。毕竟，我并没有逃离过去。我的思绪总是回到那个女孩身上；不可思议的是，我竟然曾经想要忘记她。这样的遗忘是可怕的，是不可能的。她仿佛是我身体的一部分，我不能没有她。但我现在却想去印德里斯，因此心里产生了矛盾。她仿佛用瘦弱的手臂阻止我，牵绊着我，不让我前行。

I tried to stop thinking about her, to fix my mind on those innocent gentle creatures, their sweet, eerie singing. But she persistently distracted me with thoughts that were less than innocent. Her face haunted me: the sweep of her long lashes, her timid enchanting smile; and then a change of expression I could produce at will, a sudden shift, a bruised look, a quick change to terror, to tears. The strength of the temptation alarmed me. The black descending arm of the executioner; my hands seizing her wrists . . . I was afraid the dream might turn out to be real . . . Something in her demanded victimization and terror, so she corrupted my dreams, led me into dark places I had no wish to explore. It was no longer clear to me which of us was the victim. Perhaps we were victims of one another.  
我试图停止思念她，把心思放在那些无辜温和的生物上，聆听它们甜美而诡异的歌声。然而，她执意让我分心，带来不那么纯洁的思绪。她的脸庞萦绕在我脑海中：那长长的睫毛轻扫，她羞怯而迷人的微笑；接着我可以随意引发她的表情变化，一瞬间的转变，受伤的神色，迅速转为恐惧、泪水。诱惑的力量令我感到惊恐。行刑人的黑色手臂降下；我的手紧紧握住她的手腕……我害怕梦境可能会成真……她身上似乎有种需要受害和恐惧的东西，这腐蚀了我的梦境，引导我进入那些我无意探寻的黑暗之地。我已经无法分清我们之中谁是受害者。也许，我们是彼此的受害者。

I was desperately worried when I thought of the situation I had left behind. I walked round and round the decks, wondering what had happened, whether the warden had got away, whether she had been with him. No news was received on board ship. I could only wait, in great anxiety and impatience, to reach a port where I could go ashore and get some information. At last the day came. The steward had pressed my suit. He brought it back with a buttonhole, a red carnation he had got hold of somehow. Its strong color looked well against the light gray material.  
我满怀忧虑地思索着我离开的那个局势。我在甲板上不停地踱步，揣测着发生了什么，猜想看守长是否逃脱，她是否和他在一起。船上没有任何消息传来，我只能焦急而不安地等待着，盼望着到达港口，能上岸获取一些信息。终于，那一天来了。服务员熨好了我的西装，还特意给我别上了一朵红色的康乃馨，不知他是从哪里弄来的。这鲜艳的红色在浅灰色的衣料上显得格外出色。

Just as I was ready to leave my cabin, there was a peremptory bang on the door, and a plain-clothes policeman came in without waiting for me to answer. He did not take off his hat, but opened his jacket to show the official badge, the pistol in its armpit holster. I gave him my passport. He flipped over the pages contemptuously, looked me up and down in an insolent way, stared hard and with particular disapproval at the red carnation. Everything about my appearance obviously confirmed the low opinion he had already formed. I asked what he wanted with me, received no answer but an insulting silence: I would not ask again. He produced a pair of handcuffs, dangled them in front of me. I said nothing. When he tired of the jingling, he put them away, observing that, out of respect for my country, handcuffs would not be used. I was to be allowed to walk off the ship with him. But I had better not play any games.  
就在我准备离开舱房时，门上响起了一声急促的敲击，一个便衣警察没有等我回应便走了进来。他没有摘下帽子，只是拉开了夹克，露出了官方徽章和腋下的手枪。我把护照递给他，他不屑地翻动着，粗鲁地上下打量我，特别是对那朵红色的康乃馨露出了极度的不满。他显然已经对我形成了低劣的印象，我的外貌无疑加深了他的这种看法。我问他找我有什么事，但他只是以侮辱性的沉默回应。我不再问。他掏出了一副手铐，在我面前晃来晃去。我一言不发。等他玩够了，他才把手铐收起来，说出于对我国家的尊重，不会用手铐。他会允许我和他一起走下船。但他警告我，最好不要耍任何花招。

The sun shone, everybody was going ashore. In the crowd I kept close beside him, as agreed. I was not worried. Such things happened. I gathered that I was wanted for interrogation, and wondered what questions I would be asked, and how they had got hold of my name. Uniformed police were waiting for us in a side street just off the quay. They ordered me into an armored car with black glass in the windows. After a short drive, we stopped at a large municipal building in a quiet square. Birds were singing. I noted the sound specially after the days at sea.  
太阳高照，人人都在上岸。我按约定紧跟在他身旁，没有感到任何忧虑。这样的事情时有发生。我大概是要被带去审讯，心中盘算着会被问到什么问题，以及他们是如何知道我的名字的。穿制服的警察在码头边的一个小巷子里等着我们，命令我上了一辆装有黑色玻璃的装甲车。短途行驶后，我们停在一个安静广场上的一栋大型市政建筑前。鸟儿在歌唱。经过数日的海上漂泊，我特意留意到了这声音。

The few passers-by paid no attention to us. But a girl standing at the corner a few yards away took some interest, judging by her frequent glances in my direction. I saw that she was selling spring flowers, jonquils, dwarf irises, wild tulips, and among them a bunch of red carnations, like the one I was wearing. Then armed figures fell in round me, marched me into the building and down a long corridor. “Get a move on.” A powerful hand gripped my elbow, pushed me up some steps. Double doors at the top opened into a hall where people sat in tiers as at a theater, a magistrate enthroned facing them. “In you go!” Various hard hands pulled and shoved me into a sort of pew. “Halt!” Feet stamped smartly to right and left, and I looked round, feeling detached from the situation. A high ceiling, closed windows, no sun, no singing birds, on each side of me men with guns, everywhere staring faces. People whispered or cleared their throats. The jury looked tired, or bored. Somebody read out my name and particulars, all quite correct. I confirmed them and took the oath.  
过路的几乎没人注意我们。但在几码外的拐角处，一个卖花的女孩频频朝我看过来，她似乎对我们产生了一些兴趣。我看到她在卖春天的花朵，有水仙、矮鸢尾、野郁金香，花束中还夹着几支红色康乃馨，像我佩戴的那朵。这时，武装人员把我围住，带着我走进了大楼，穿过一条长长的走廊。“快点！”一只强有力的手抓住我的肘部，推着我上了几级台阶。双门在顶端打开，里面是一个大厅，仿佛剧院一样，观众坐成梯形，对面是端坐在高台上的法官。“进去！”几只粗硬的手拉扯着我，把我推进了一个类似教堂长椅的位置。“停！”脚步声整齐地在左右两侧响起，我环顾四周，感觉自己与情景脱节。高高的天花板，紧闭的窗户，没有阳光，没有鸟鸣，身边是荷枪实弹的士兵，到处是盯着我的目光。人们低声细语或清了清嗓子。陪审团看起来疲惫不堪，或是厌倦了。有人念出了我的姓名和详细信息，一切都准确无误。我确认了信息并宣了誓。

The case was that a girl had vanished, supposed kidnapped, possibly murdered. A well-known person had been suspected and questioned, and had accused someone else who could not be found. The girl’s name was mentioned; I was asked if I knew her. I replied that I had known her for several years. “You were intimate with her?” “We were old friends.” There was laughter; somebody asked: “What was your relationship with her?” “I’ve told you; we were old friends.” More laughter, silenced by an official. “You expect us to believe that you changed your plans all at once, dropped everything you were doing, in order to follow a friend to a foreign country?” They seemed to know all about me. I said: “That is the truth.”  
案件是关于一个女孩失踪的事情，据说她可能被绑架，甚至被谋杀。一个知名人物被怀疑并接受了质询，他指控另一个找不到的人。提到了女孩的名字，他们问我是否认识她。我回答说我认识她已经有好几年了。“你和她关系亲密吗？”“我们是老朋友。”这引发了阵阵笑声，有人问：“你和她是什么关系？”“我已经说了，我们是老朋友。”更多的笑声，随后被一个官员制止。“你要我们相信你突然改变计划，放弃你正在做的事情，只为了跟随一个朋友到外国？”他们似乎对我的情况了如指掌。我说：“这就是事实。”

I sat on the bed, smoking, watching her face in the mirror as she combed her hair, the smooth sheen of the glittering mass of palely shining hair, its silvery fall on her shoulders. She leaned forward to look at herself, the glass reflected the beginning of her small breasts. I watched them move with her breathing, went and stood behind her, put my arms round her, covered them with my hands. She pulled away from me. Not wanting to see her frightened expression, I blew smoke in her face. She went on resisting, and I had an impulse to do certain things with the lighted cigarette, dropped it on the floor, put my foot on it. Then I pulled her closer to me. She struggled, cried: “Don’t! Leave me alone! I hate you! You’re cruel and treacherous . . . you betray people, break promises . . .” I was impatient, I let her go and went over to lock the door. Before I got there, a sound made me turn round. She was holding a big bottle of eau-de-Cologne over her head, meaning to hit me with it. I told her to put it down; she took no notice, so I went back and twisted it out of her hand. She was not strong enough to put up a fight. There was no more strength in her muscles than in a child’s.  
我坐在床上抽烟，看着她在镜子里梳头。她那一头亮丽的银发在肩头柔顺地滑落。她向前倾身，镜子里映出她微小的胸脯，我看着它们随呼吸起伏。我走到她身后，双手环抱她，覆在她胸上。她推开了我。我不想看到她惊恐的表情，便向她脸上吹了一口烟。她继续抗拒，我突然想用点燃的香烟做些事，便把香烟扔在地上，用脚踩灭。然后我把她拉得更近。她挣扎着，哭喊：“不要！放开我！我恨你！你太残忍、太狡诈……你背叛别人，违背承诺……”我感到不耐烦，松开她，走过去锁门。就在这时，身后传来一声响，我回头一看，她正举着一大瓶古龙水，打算用它砸我。我让她放下，她不理会，于是我回去把它从她手里扭了过来。她根本没有力量抵抗，她的肌肉就像个孩子一样无力。

While she was getting dressed I continued to sit on the bed. We did not speak to each other. She was ready, fastening her coat, when the door opened suddenly: in my impatience just now, I had forgotten to go back and lock it. A man came in. I jumped up to throw him out, but he walked past as though I was invisible or not present.  
她在穿衣服的时候，我继续坐在床上。我们两个没有交谈。她准备好了，正在系外套，这时门突然打开了：我刚才因为心急忘了回去锁门。一个男人走了进来。我跳起来想把他赶出去，但他径直走过去，仿佛我不存在一样。

A tall, athletic, arrogant-looking man, with an almost paranoid air of assurance. His very bright and blue eyes flashed a danger signal, seemed not to see me. The girl was petrified, she did nothing at all. I did nothing either, simply stood watching. It was unlike me. But he was a man who had entered with a revolver for a specific purpose, and could not be prevented from carrying it out. I wondered if he would shoot us both, and if so which first, or if only one of us, which one. Such points were of interest to me.  
一个高大、健壮、看起来傲慢的男人，带着一种几乎偏执的自信气息。他那双明亮而湛蓝的眼睛闪烁着危险的信号，似乎没有注意到我。女孩吓呆了，完全什么也没做。我也什么都没做，只是站在一旁观望。这不像是我平常的反应。但他是一个携带手枪进来，明确有特定目的的男人，而且无法阻止他完成这个目的。我不禁想知道他会不会开枪击毙我们两个，如果是的话，谁会先被射杀，或者只有其中一个，那会是谁。这些问题对我来说充满了兴趣。

It was clear that he regarded her as his property. I considered that she belonged to me. Between the two of us she was reduced to nothing; her only function might have been to link us together. His face wore the look of extreme arrogance which always repelled me. Yet I suddenly felt an indescribable affinity with him, a sort of blood-contact, generating confusion, so that I began to wonder if there were two of us . . .  
显然，他把她视为自己的财产。而我则认为她属于我。在我们之间，她几乎变得无足轻重；她唯一的作用可能只是连接我们的纽带。他的脸上带着极度傲慢的表情，这种态度总是让我感到厌恶。然而，我突然感受到一种无法言喻的亲近感，一种血液上的联系，使我产生了困惑，开始怀疑是否存在两个我……

I was asked: “What happened when you met your friend?” “We did not meet.” Subdued excitement broke out, an official voice had to order silence. The next voice sounded like an actor’s, trained in elocution. “I wish to state that the witness is a psychopath, probably schizoid, and therefore not to be believed.” Someone interjected: “Produce a psychiatrist’s confirmation.” The theatrical voice continued: “I repeat, with all possible emphasis, that this man is known to be a psychopath and totally unreliable. We are investigating an atrocious crime against an innocent pure young girl: I ask you to note his unnatural callousness, his indifferent expression. What cynicism to come here with that flower in his buttonhole! How arrogantly he displays his utter contempt for the sanctity of family life, and for all decent feeling! His attitude is not only abnormal, but depraved, infamous, a desecration of all we hold sacred . . .”  
有人问我：“你和你的朋友见面时发生了什么？”“我们没有见面。”一种压抑的兴奋突然爆发了，一位官员的声音不得不命令大家保持安静。接下来的声音听起来像是一个受过演讲训练的演员在说话。“我想声明，这位证人是个精神病患者，可能是偏执型精神分裂症，因此不可信。”有人插话道：“请出示精神科医生的证明。”那个戏剧化的声音继续说道：“我再次强调，这个人被公认为精神病患者，完全不可信。我们正在调查一桩针对一位无辜纯洁年轻女孩的可怕罪行：请注意他的冷酷无情，他那漠然的表情。带着胸前那朵花来到这里，真是何等的玩世不恭！他傲慢地展示了他对家庭生活的神圣性以及一切体面情感的彻底蔑视！他的态度不仅异常，而且堕落、可耻，是对我们所珍视的一切的亵渎……”

Somewhere high up in the room, where I could not see it, a bell rang. A superior, unimplicated voice stated: “A psychopath is not an acceptable witness.”  
房间高处某个我看不到的地方响起了铃声。一个冷漠而不涉及其中的声音说道：“精神病患者不具备作证资格。”

I was taken away, locked in a cell for seventeen hours. In the early morning they released me without explanation. In the meantime, the ship had gone, and with it my luggage. I was stranded with only the clothes I was wearing. Luckily, I had not been deprived of either my passport or my wallet, and was well provided with money.  
我被带走，关在一个牢房里十七个小时。清晨，他们在没有解释的情况下把我放了。在此期间，船已经开走了，连同我的行李。我被困在那里，只有身上穿的衣服。幸运的是，我的护照和钱包都没有被拿走，我的钱也够用。

I had a shave, a wash and brush up, and looked carefully at my reflection. I needed a clean shirt, but the shops were not yet open; I would buy one later and change. For the moment my appearance was passable, or would be when I had got rid of the dead carnation. I meant to throw it into the gutter as I left the barber’s shop, but a boy just outside offered to clean my shoes, and while he did so I asked him which was the best café. He pointed out one further along the same street; I walked on, liked the look of it, and sat down at one of the tables outside in the sun. At that hour the place was deserted. The solitary waiter on duty brought coffee and rolls on a tray, then returned to the dark interior, leaving me there alone. I drank the coffee, wondered what to do next, watched the passers-by: there were not many of them so early.  
我刮了胡子，洗漱整理了一番，仔细端详了自己的倒影。我需要一件干净的衬衫，但商店还没开门；我打算稍后去买一件换上。此刻我的外表还算过得去，至少在扔掉那朵枯萎的康乃馨后会好一些。我本打算离开理发店时把它扔进路边的水沟里，但刚出门一个小男孩提出要擦我的鞋，我让他擦鞋时问他哪家咖啡馆最好。他指了指同一条街上更远一点的地方；我走了过去，喜欢那家店的样子，便在阳光下的一张外面的桌子旁坐下。那时咖啡馆里空无一人。唯一在值班的服务员端来了一盘咖啡和面包卷，然后回到了黑暗的室内，把我独自留在那里。我喝着咖啡，想着接下来该做什么，看着路人：这么早的时候行人寥寥无几。

A girl went past carrying a basket of flowers, reminding me that, in the end, I had not disposed of the carnation. I tried to pull it out of my buttonhole, but the stem had been securely pinned by the steward. I turned back my lapel, peered down, felt about for the pin. Someone said: “Let me do that for you.” I looked up; the flower girl was smiling at me. I seemed to have seen her face somewhere, I felt I already knew her and liked her. Having removed the carnation neatly, she prepared to replace it with one exactly the same from her basket. I was on the point of saying I did not want it, when something occurred to me and I kept silent. She fixed the fresh flower in my buttonhole and continued to stand beside me, although not as if she was merely waiting for payment. It looked as if my idea was correct, but I said nothing in case I was mistaken. I knew I had been right when she asked: “Is there anything else you’d like me to do?” I glanced round. The other tables were still deserted, the people on the pavement were out of earshot. She had put down her basket on a chair; I pretended to examine the flowers, picking up one bunch after another. To anyone watching, even through field-glasses, we would have appeared to be conducting a normal transaction. I said, “Certainly,” although I wondered if she . . . But I had to find out without delay what had been going on in the world. “I’ve been at sea; out of touch. There are lots of things you can tell me.”  
一个女孩抱着一篮花走过，提醒我最终还没有处理掉那朵康乃馨。我试图把它从扣眼中拔出来，但茎被服务员牢牢地别住了。我掀开衣领，低头仔细查看，摸索着找那个别针。有人说：“让我来帮你吧。”我抬头一看，那个卖花的女孩正微笑着看着我。我似乎在什么地方见过她，觉得我已经认识并且喜欢她了。她巧妙地取下了康乃馨，准备用她篮子里一朵一模一样的花替换。我正要说我不需要，忽然想到了一些事，便保持了沉默。她把新的花别在我的扣眼上，继续站在我旁边，但不像只是等着收钱的样子。看起来我的想法是对的，但我什么也没说，以防自己错了。当她问我：“还有什么需要我帮忙的吗？”我就知道我猜对了。我环顾四周，其他的桌子仍然空着，街上的行人也在听不见的距离。她把花篮放在一把椅子上，我假装在仔细挑选花束，一束又一束地拿起放下。对于任何正在观察我们的人，即使是用望远镜看，我们看起来也只是进行一笔普通的交易。我说：“当然。”尽管我在想她是否……但我必须立即了解外界发生了什么。“我一直在海上，与世隔绝。有很多事情你可以告诉我。”

I asked cautious questions, trying not to show the extent of my ignorance of the latest developments. It appeared that the situation at home was obscure and alarming, no precise information was coming through, the full extent of the disaster was not yet known. The warden of a northern country had escaped to the interior and joined forces with one of the various warlords, between whom hostilities had broken out.  
我小心翼翼地问了一些问题，试图不显露出我对最新局势的无知。看来国内的形势既模糊又令人不安，没有准确的信息传来，灾难的全貌尚未揭晓。北方某国的监狱长已经逃往内地，并与各个交战的军阀之一联合起来，而这些军阀之间已经爆发了冲突。

I went on questioning her. She was always polite and friendly, and tried to be helpful. But her answers grew vague, she seemed afraid to commit herself. When one or two people drifted into the café and sat down near us, she said in a whisper: “You’ll have to discuss these matters with somebody higher up. Do you want me to arrange it?” I agreed at once, but was rather skeptical about her power to do this. She told me to wait, picked up her basket, and rushed off down the street, half running. I thought I had probably seen the last of her, but ordered more coffee, waited; I had nothing else to do. The news she had given me of the warden’s escape had relieved my mind, up to a point; it seemed likely, although by no means certain, that he had taken the girl with him. Time passed. There were plenty of people about now. I watched the street for my informant’s return. Just as I had decided she was not coming back, I saw her hurrying toward me between the passers-by. As she came to my table she called out: “Here are the violets you wanted. I had to go all the way to the flower market for them. I’m afraid they’re rather expensive.” She was out of breath, but made her voice sound clear and gay for the benefit of the people round us. I saw that it would be no good trying to persuade her to stay, and asked: “How much?” She named a sum, I handed over the money. She thanked me with a charming smile, darted away, and disappeared in the crowd.  
我继续向她提问，她始终彬彬有礼，态度友好，并试图提供帮助。但她的回答越来越模糊，似乎害怕做出承诺。当一两个人走进咖啡馆，坐在我们附近时，她低声说：“你得和更高层的人讨论这些事情。你要我帮你安排吗？”我立刻同意了，但对她是否有能力做到这点持怀疑态度。她让我等着，拿起花篮，急匆匆地沿街跑了。我以为这可能是最后一次见到她了，但还是点了更多的咖啡，耐心等待；反正我也无事可做。她告诉我监狱长逃走的消息让我稍微安心了一些，似乎有可能，但还不能确定，他是否带上了那个女孩。时间流逝，现在周围的人越来越多了。我注视着街道，等着她回来。就在我决定她不会再回来了的时候，我看到她在人群中向我走来。当她走到我的桌前时，她喊道：“你要的紫罗兰来了。我不得不一路跑到花市去买，恐怕有点贵。”她气喘吁吁，但为了周围的人，她使劲让自己的声音听起来清晰而愉快。我看出再劝她留下来也没有用，便问：“多少钱？”她说了一个数目，我递过了钱。她以迷人的微笑感谢了我，迅速离开，消失在人群中。

The stalks of the violets were wrapped in paper with words written on it. I was told where to find the man who might help me. The message was to be destroyed immediately. I bought a canvas bag with leather handles and straps to hold a few necessities, then booked at a hotel. When I had bathed and changed, I went to the office of the man named on the paper, who saw me at once. He too was wearing a red carnation. I should have to be careful.  
紫罗兰的花茎用纸包着，上面写着一些字。我被告知在哪里可以找到那个可能帮助我的人。这个信息必须立即销毁。我买了一个带皮质把手和肩带的帆布包来装一些必需品，然后在一家酒店订了房。洗澡换衣服后，我去了纸上提到的人的办公室，他立刻见了我。他也戴着一朵红色康乃馨。我必须格外小心。

I went straight to the point, there was no object in prevaricating. Naming the town from which the warden was operating, I asked if it was possible for me to get there. “No. Fighting is going on in the area, night raids on the town. No foreigners allowed in.” “No exceptions?” He shook his head. “Anyway, there’s no transport except for official personnel.” After all these negative statements, I could only say: “Then you advise me to give up the idea?” “Officially speaking, yes.” He looked at me slyly. “But not necessarily.” His expression was more encouraging. “There’s just a chance I may be able to help you. Anyway, I’ll see what can be done. But don’t count on it. It will probably be a few days before I have anything to report.” I thanked him. We stood up and shook hands. He promised to notify me immediately he had any news.  
我直奔主题，没有必要拖延。提到监狱长活动的那个城镇后，我问他我是否有可能去那里。“不行。那里正发生战斗，晚上对城镇进行空袭。不允许外国人进入。”“没有例外吗？”他摇了摇头。“而且除了官方人员外，也没有交通工具。”听到这些否定的回答后，我只能说：“那么，你建议我放弃这个想法？”“官方来说，是的。”他狡黠地看了我一眼。“但也不一定。”他的表情变得更加鼓舞人心。“有可能我能帮到你。不管怎样，我会看看能做些什么。但不要指望太高。可能需要几天才能有消息。”我向他表示感谢。我们站起来握了握手。他承诺一有消息就会立即通知我。

I felt bored and restless. I had nothing to do. On the surface, the life of the town appeared normal, but underneath it was coming gradually to a standstill. The news from the north was scanty, confused, frightening. I realized that the destruction must have been on a gigantic scale. Little could have survived. The local broadcasters were cheerfully reassuring. It was the official policy, the population had to be kept calm. But these men actually seemed to believe their country would escape the cataclysm. I knew no country was safe, no matter how far removed from the present devastation, which would spread and spread, and ultimately cover the entire planet. Meanwhile, universal unrest was inevitable. It was the worst possible sign that war had already started, even though on a minor scale. That the more responsible governments were doing their utmost to pacify the belligerents only stressed the explosive nature of the situation, and the ominous threat of all-out warfare augmenting the present catastrophe. My anxiety about the girl, which had subsided slightly, revived again. She had gained nothing by escaping the destruction of one country, if she had gone to another about to engage in a full-scale war. I tried to believe the warden had sent her to safety, but knew too much about him to feel sure of that. It was absolutely essential for me to see him; otherwise I would never find out what had happened to her. I spent the evening in different bars, listening to the talk. His name was often mentioned, occasionally as a traitor to his own people, more frequently as a new, powerful, unknown influence on the war issue, a significant figure, a man to watch.  
我感到无聊和焦躁，没有事情可做。表面上，这个城市的生活看起来很正常，但实质上却在逐渐停滞。从北方传来的消息少得可怜，混乱而令人恐惧。我意识到那里的破坏一定是空前巨大的，几乎没有什么能够幸免。当地广播员用愉快的语调不断安抚民众，这是官方的政策，要让民众保持冷静。但这些人似乎真的相信他们的国家可以躲过这场浩劫。我知道没有哪个国家是安全的，无论离现在的灾难多远，这场浩劫都会不断扩散，最终覆盖整个星球。与此同时，普遍的动荡是不可避免的。战争已经开始，哪怕规模不大，也意味着最坏的情况正在发生。那些更负责任的政府正在竭尽全力平息交战方的情绪，这反而凸显了局势的爆炸性，以及全面战争进一步加剧当前灾难的阴影。我对女孩的担忧本来稍微平息了一些，现在又再次涌上心头。如果她逃离了一个国家的毁灭，却来到另一个即将陷入全面战争的地方，那她也没有得到什么好处。我试图相信监狱长已经把她送到了安全的地方，但对他了解太多，无法确信这一点。我必须见到他，否则永远不会知道她发生了什么。晚上我在不同的酒吧里徘徊，听着人们的谈话。他的名字经常被提到，有时被称为叛徒，但更多时候是作为战争问题上的一个新兴的、强大的、未知的影响力人物，一个重要的人物，一个值得关注的人。

First thing in the morning the telephone rang in my room: someone wanted to see me. I said the person was to come up, hoping for a message from the official. “Hullo.” The flower girl entered, smiling and unselfconscious. She saw my surprise. “Forgotten me already?” I said I had not expected her here. She looked surprised now. “But you know it’s part of my job to bring your flower every morning.” I kept quiet while she fixed the carnation. It was fatally easy to show my ignorance of the organization to which she belonged. I was curious about it, but afraid of giving myself away. It occurred to me that, by spending more time with her, I might pick up information without asking questions. Besides, she was young and attractive, I liked her natural, matter-of-fact behavior. It would relieve the boredom.  
一大早，电话在我房间里响了：有人想见我。我说让那个人上来，希望是来自那位官员的信息。“你好。”卖花女孩走进来，微笑着，毫不拘束。她看到了我的惊讶，“已经忘了我了吗？”我说我没想到她会来这儿。她现在显得有些惊讶了，“可是你知道，每天早上给你送花是我的工作的一部分。”她在给我别上康乃馨时，我保持了沉默。我极容易暴露出对她所属组织的无知，我对它很感兴趣，但害怕暴露自己。想到多花些时间和她在一起，或许可以在不问问题的情况下得到一些信息。而且，她年轻又有吸引力，我喜欢她那种自然、坦率的行为。这能缓解我的无聊。

I invited her to dinner that evening. Her manners were charming, she acted in her usual engaging, unaffected way. Later we went to two nightclubs, danced. She was a delightful partner, seemed relaxed and talked freely, but told me nothing I did not already know. I took her back to the hotel with me; the porter looked the other way when we came in together. I was rather drunk. Her full skirt fell in a shining ring on the floor of my room. Very early in the morning, while I was still asleep, she left to go to the flower market; was back at breakfast time with a fresh carnation, bright eyed, cheerful and full of life, more attractive than she had been in the dark. I wanted to keep her with me, to anchor myself in the present through her. But she said: “No, I must go now, I have my work to do,” then smiled in the friendliest way and promised to dance with me in the evening. I never saw her again.  
我邀请她当晚共进晚餐。她举止优雅，依旧是那种迷人而自然的样子。后来我们去了两个夜总会，跳舞。她是一个愉快的舞伴，显得放松，自由地交谈，但没有告诉我什么新信息。我带她回到酒店时，门房假装没看见我们一起进来。我有些醉了。她那件蓬松的裙子在我的房间地板上形成了一个闪亮的圆环。清晨我还在睡觉时，她离开去花市了；早餐时间，她带着一朵新鲜的康乃馨回来，眼睛明亮，神采飞扬，比黑夜里更具魅力。我想让她留在我身边，通过她将自己锚定在当下。但她说：“不，我必须走了，我有工作要做。”然后，她以最友好的方式微笑着，答应晚上和我再跳舞。我再也没有见过她。

The official sent for me while I was reading the papers. I hurried round to his office. He greeted me with a mysterious, conspiratorial air. “I’ve been able to arrange that matter for you. It’ll be a bit of a rush.” He grinned, pleased with himself, pleased to show me how he could manipulate events. I was surprised and excited. He went on: “A lorry happens to be leaving today with important replacements for the new transmitter that’s going up on our side of the frontier. It’s quite near the town you want. I’ve got you signed on as a foreign consultant. You can do your homework on the way. It’s all in here.” He handed me a thick folder full of papers, a travel permit on top, told me to be at the main post office in half an hour.  
正在我看报纸时，那位官员派人来找我。我匆忙赶到他的办公室。他用一种神秘而合作的神态迎接我。“我已经为你安排好了那件事。时间有点紧张。”他得意地笑了，显然对自己的操纵能力很满意。我既惊讶又兴奋。他继续说道：“今天正好有一辆卡车要运送重要设备去边境我们这边的新发射站。那个地方离你要去的城镇很近。我给你安排了一个外籍顾问的身份。你可以在路上了解一下背景情况，这里全都有。”他递给我一个装满文件的厚文件夹，最上面是一份旅行许可证，并告诉我要在半小时内到达中央邮局。

I thanked him profusely. He patted my arm. “Think nothing of it. Glad I could be useful.” Withdrawing his hand, he touched the flower in my buttonhole and gave me a fright. Did he suspect something? If I had discovered nothing else about his organization, I at least knew now that it had considerable power. I was relieved when he said with a smile: “Hurry back and collect your things. You mustn’t be late on any account. The driver has orders to leave on the dot, and he won’t wait for anyone.”  
我满怀感激地感谢他。他拍了拍我的手臂。“没什么，能帮上忙我很高兴。”他收回手，轻轻碰了碰我纽扣孔里的花，这让我吓了一跳。他是不是怀疑了什么？虽然我对他的组织没了解多少，但至少现在知道它权势不小。当他微笑着说：“赶快回去收拾你的东西。无论如何你都不能迟到。司机有命令准时出发，他不会等任何人。”我才感到松了口气。

The room had been getting darker, a sudden storm had blown up. As his hand moved to the light, a livid flash and a crash came together, a splatter of rain hit the windows, and somebody wearing the long overcoat of a uniform entered and signed to him not to touch the switch. I could only just distinguish a big, heavily built man, whose massive shape seemed vaguely familiar. He stood talking to the official in undertones at the far end of the room, while I tried unsuccessfully to hear the low but heated discussion, of which I knew I was the subject, for they both kept glancing at me. It was obvious that I was being denigrated. Although the newcomer’s face remained indistinct, between thunderclaps I could hear the accusing tone of his voice, but without being able to catch the words. He seemed already to have succeeded in discrediting me with the other man, who stood nearer the light, and showed signs of uneasiness and suspicion.  
房间渐渐暗了下来，突然一场暴风雨袭来。当他的手伸向灯光开关时，一道闪电伴随着巨大的雷声骤然袭来，雨点猛烈地打在窗户上，一个穿着制服长外套的人走了进来，示意他不要碰开关。我勉强辨认出这是一个魁梧高大的男人，他那庞大的身躯似乎隐约有些熟悉。他站在房间的另一端，低声和那位官员交谈，而我则努力去听这场低沉而激烈的讨论，但无济于事。我知道他们的谈话是关于我的，因为他们不时地朝我看过来。显然，他们在诋毁我。虽然新来者的脸看不清楚，但在雷鸣间隙中，我能听到他指责的语气，却无法听清具体的词句。他似乎已经成功地使那位站在灯光较近处的官员对我产生了怀疑和不安。

I was getting very uneasy myself. My position would be most unpleasant if he turned against me. Not only would I lose all hope of reaching the warden, but be shown up as having made use of the red carnation under false pretenses. There was a serious danger that I would be re-arrested and put in prison again.  
我自己也变得非常不安。如果他转而对我不利，我的处境将非常不愉快。我不仅失去了接触监狱长的所有希望，还会被揭穿使用红色康乃馨的虚假借口。有严重的危险，我会再次被逮捕并重新关进监狱。

I looked at my watch. Several minutes of the half hour had elapsed, and, feeling that I had to get out of the room quickly, I made an unobtrusive move to the door, opening it with my hand behind me.  
我看了看手表。半个小时已经过去了几分钟，感觉我必须尽快离开房间，我悄然向门口移动，手后伸开门。

A terrific flash split the air, luridly lit up a sudden flurry of movement, the folds of the overcoat swinging, its wearer pointing a gun. As I raised my hands, he half turned to shout above the exploding thunder to the man to whom he had been talking: “What did I tell you?” The momentary dividing of his attention gave me time to dive at his legs in a tackle I learned at school, while the shot went over my head. I did not manage to bring him down, but caught him off balance, hampered by the length of the coat. Before he could aim again, I had knocked the revolver out of his hand, sent it flying across the room. He came at me directly, threw his whole weight against me in a vicious onslaught, hitting hard with both fists. He was much heavier than I was, I almost fell. The door saved me; clinging to it, I heard steps coming along the passage. My opponent attacked me fiercely again, shouting to the official to retrieve his gun. Once he got hold of it I was done for. In desperation, I bashed the door into him, kicked him with all my strength, had the satisfaction of seeing him fold up before I swung round. Two new figures materialized in my way. I did not look at them, simply hurled them aside, one after the other, heard one fall with a cry, and the crash of the door as he fell against it. Nobody else tried to stop me; without looking back, I rushed down the corridor and out of the building. Thanks to the thunder, the shot could not have been heard beyond the adjoining office.  
一道闪电划破长空，耀眼的光芒中突然出现了一阵混乱，外套的褶皱在空气中翻飞，持枪者正在瞄准。我举起双手，他转过身来，高喊着对他交谈的那个人说：“我早就告诉你了！”他注意力暂时被分散，我抓住时机用在学校学到的擒拿动作扑向他的双腿，子弹从我头顶掠过。我没能把他完全扑倒，但让他失去了平衡，长外套也束缚了他的动作。在他重新瞄准之前，我已经击打他手中的手枪，将它打飞到房间的另一端。他立刻扑向我，发起恶狠狠的攻击，用双拳猛烈击打我。他比我重得多，我几乎摔倒。幸好门挡住了我，我紧紧抓住门，听到走廊上传来的脚步声。我的对手又一次凶狠地攻击我，喊着让官员捡起他的枪。一旦他拿到枪，我就完了。我绝望之下，用门猛撞他，用尽全力踢他，看到他折腰倒下让我心生一丝满足。我旋转过身，看到两个人挡住了去路。我没多看他们，直接一个接一个地把他们推开，听到其中一个倒地的叫声和撞门的声音。没有人再试图拦住我，我不再回头，飞奔出走廊，冲出大楼。多亏了雷声，枪声应该没有传到隔壁的办公室。

The storm continued to help me. I was not noticed outside, everyone had taken shelter from the torrential rain. The streets were swimming with water, I was wet through in a second, kept running as fast as I could, splashing along as if in a shallow stream. Luckily I knew where the main post office was and made straight for it. Instructions to detain me would have been telephoned to my hotel, and anyhow I had no time to go there. As it was, the lorry driver was starting his engine when I came up, waving my travel documents for him to see. He scowled at me, and jerked his thumb at the back of the vehicle. I made a final effort and scrambled up, subsided on to something extremely hard. Someone immediately shut out the rain and the daylight; there was a tremendous lurch; we were off. I was breathless, bruised all over and soaking wet, but I felt triumphant.  
风暴继续帮助了我。外面没有人注意到我，大家都在躲避倾盆大雨。街道上水流成河，我瞬间就浑身湿透了，尽可能快地跑着，水花四溅，就像在浅溪里奔跑一样。幸运的是，我知道邮政总局的位置，直奔那里而去。对我的扣留指令可能已经打电话通知了酒店，无论如何，我没有时间回去。正巧，当我赶到时，卡车司机正启动发动机，我挥舞着旅行证件让他看到。他对我皱起眉头，粗暴地用大拇指指了指车厢后面。我使出最后的力气，爬上了车厢，跌坐在一块极硬的东西上。有人立刻关上了车厢门，挡住了雨水和阳光；车子猛地一颠，我们出发了。我气喘吁吁，全身都是淤青，浑身湿透，但我感到胜利在握。

Four of us were crowded inside the lorry. It was dark, noisy and uncomfortable, like being in some sort of tent with planks to sit on, but not enough head room to sit up straight. Two on each plank, we crouched face to face in the congested darkness, among stacked packing-cases of different shapes and sizes. I hardly noticed the painful jolting, I was so relieved to be there, actually on my way, shut inside that cramped, comfortless, moving tent, where nobody could see me. The storm gradually died out, but the rain still streamed down, and eventually found its way through our canvas walk without damping my spirits. It could not possibly make me any wetter than I already was.  
车厢里挤了四个人。里面又黑又吵，极为不舒服，就像待在一个搭在木板上的帐篷里，却没有足够的空间让人坐直。我们两个一排，面对面蜷缩在堆满各种形状和大小的箱子之间的狭小黑暗中。我几乎没有注意到颠簸带来的疼痛，只是感到无比的宽慰，终于踏上了路程，关在这狭窄、毫无舒适感的移动帐篷里，没人能看到我。暴风雨逐渐平息，但雨水仍然倾泻而下，最终渗透进了我们身处的帆布篷里，不过这丝毫没有影响我的好心情。反正我已经浑身湿透了，雨水也不会让我变得更湿。
