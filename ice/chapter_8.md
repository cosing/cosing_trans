## EIGHT

I tried to make friends with my companions, young fellows straight from a technical college; but they would not talk. They distrusted me because I was a foreigner. When I asked questions, they suspected me of trying to find out things that were to be kept secret, although I could see that they themselves knew no secrets. They were incredibly naïve. I felt I belonged to another dimension, and became silent. By degrees they forgot about me and started talking among themselves. They spoke of their work; of difficulties in assembling the transmitter. Lack of materials; lack of trained personnel; lack of funds; bad workmanship; unaccountable errors. I heard the word sabotage muttered back and forth. The work was far behind schedule. The transmitter should have been functioning at the end of the month. Now no one knew when it would be finished. Exhausted, I closed my eyes, stopped listening.  
我试图与我的同伴们交朋友，他们都是刚从技术学院出来的年轻人；但他们不愿与我交谈。他们不信任我，因为我是外国人。当我问问题时，他们怀疑我是在试图探听一些应该保密的事情，尽管我可以看出他们自己也不知道什么秘密。他们天真得不可思议。我感到自己仿佛属于另一个次元，于是也不再言语。渐渐地，他们忘了我的存在，开始互相交谈起来。他们谈到他们的工作，提到了在组装发射器时遇到的困难。缺乏材料；缺乏训练有素的人员；缺乏资金；工艺差劲；不可理解的错误。我听到他们低声议论“破坏活动”。工程进度严重滞后。原计划月底发射器就该投入使用了，现在谁也不知道何时能完成。我感到疲惫，闭上眼睛，不再听他们说话。

Now and again an odd sentence reached me. Once I realized I was the subject of their conversation; they thought I was asleep. “He’s been sent to spy on us,” one of them said. “To find out if we can be trusted. We must never tell him anything, never answer his questions.” Their voices dropped, they were almost whispering. “I heard the professor say . . . They don’t explain . . . Why send us to the danger zone when other people . . .” They were dissatisfied and uneasy, and could not give me any information. I need not waste my time on them.  
不时有奇怪的句子传到我耳中。有一次，我意识到我是他们谈话的主题；他们以为我在睡觉。“他是被派来监视我们的，”其中一个说。“是来看看我们是否可信。我们绝不能告诉他任何事情，绝不回答他的问题。”他们的声音渐渐低了下去，几乎是在耳语。“我听教授说过……他们没有解释……为什么派我们去危险地带，而其他人却……”他们感到不满和不安，无法给我任何信息。我不必在他们身上浪费时间。

Late at night we stopped at a small town. I knocked up a shopkeeper, and, for the second time, provided myself with a few essentials: soap, a razor, a change of clothing. The place had only one garage: before we left in the morning, the driver insisted on buying up the entire stock of petrol. The owner protested indignantly; with supplies so restricted, he might not get any more. Our man ignored this, told him to empty the pumps, and, in response to further outraged protests, said: “Shut up, and get on with it! That’s an order.” Standing beside him, I remarked mildly that the next person expecting to fill up here would be in trouble. He gave me a scornful glance. “He’s got more hidden away somewhere. They always have.” The petrol cans were crammed into the back with the rest of the load, hardly leaving room for the four of us. I had the most uncomfortable place, over the back axle.  
深夜，我们在一个小镇停了下来。我敲开了一位店主的门，第二次为自己提供了一些必需品：香皂、剃须刀和换洗的衣物。镇上只有一个加油站：早上出发前，司机坚持把所有的汽油都买下。店主愤怒地抗议说，供应如此紧张，他可能再也得不到更多的汽油了。我们的司机不理会这些，告诉他把油箱清空，在对方进一步愤怒地抗议时说：“闭嘴，快点干！这是命令。”站在他旁边的我温和地说，下一位想在这里加油的人就有麻烦了。他轻蔑地瞥了我一眼。“他一定还有其他藏起来的地方。他们总是有。”汽油罐被塞进车后座，几乎没有给我们四个人留下什么空间。我坐在最不舒服的地方，正好在后轴上。

Flaps were rolled up, we could see out. We were driving toward a distant forest with a chain of mountains behind. A few miles from the town, the metaled road ended. Now there were only two narrow tarred strips for the wheels, as far apart as the width of the chassis. It got colder as we drove on; the climate was changing, like the character of the land. The edge of the forest was always in sight, gradually coming nearer: we passed less and less cultivation, fewer and fewer people and villages. I began to see the sense of storing the petrol. The road got steadily worse, full of ruts and holes. Progress was difficult, slow, the driver kept swearing. When even the tarred strips came to an end, I leaned over and tapped his shoulder, offered to take turns with him at the wheel. Rather to my surprise, he agreed.  
帆布卷起了，我们可以看到外面。我们正朝着远方的森林行驶，后面是一连串的山脉。离小镇几英里外，铺装的道路结束了。现在只剩下两条窄窄的柏油条带与车轮同宽。随着我们的前行，气温越来越低，气候在改变，土地的性格也在变。森林的边缘始终在视野中，渐渐靠近：我们经过的耕地越来越少，看到的人和村庄也越来越少。我开始理解储备汽油的必要性了。道路变得越来越糟，满是车辙和坑洞。前进十分困难，速度很慢，司机不断咒骂。当连柏油条带也消失时，我靠过去拍了拍他的肩膀，提出与他轮流开车。令我有些意外的是，他竟然同意了。

I had a more comfortable seat beside him, but found it an effort to handle the heavy lorry. I had never driven one before, and, until I got used to it, had to concentrate on what I was doing. It was necessary to stop at intervals to remove fallen rocks or tree trunks that blocked the way. The first time this happened, I prepared to climb out to help the others, who had already jumped down from the back and were struggling to shift the obstruction. I felt a light touch and looked round. The driver’s head made a just perceptible negative movement. My ability to drive the truck had apparently raised me above such duties in his estimation.  
我坐在他旁边，位置比较舒服，但发现操控这辆重型卡车需要费些力气。我以前从未开过卡车，在习惯之前，我必须全神贯注地驾驶。我们需要时不时停车，清理挡路的落石或树干。第一次遇到这种情况时，我准备下车帮忙，其他人已经从车后跳下，正在奋力移开障碍物。我感觉到一个轻轻的碰触，回头一看。司机微微摇了摇头。显然，我会开卡车的能力在他眼中已经让我摆脱了这种琐事。

I offered him a cigarette. He accepted. I ventured a comment on the state of the road. As the transmitter was so important and involved so much traffic, I could not understand why a decent road had not been made. He said: “We can’t afford new roads. We asked the other nations associated with us in the undertaking to contribute, but they refused.” Frowning, he gave me a sidelong glance to see where my sympathies lay. I said in a non-committal tone that this seemed unfair. “Just because we’re a small, impoverished country, they’ve treated us badly all along the line.” He could not suppress his resentment. “The transmitter could never have been built here at all if we hadn’t donated the site. They should remember that we made the whole thing possible. We sacrifice a piece of our land for the general good, but get nothing in return. They won’t even send ground troops to help to protect the position. It’s their unsympathetic attitude that creates bad feeling.” He spoke bitterly. I could feel his grudge against the big powers. “You’re a stranger . . . I shouldn’t be saying such things to you.” He looked at me with anxiety: I assured him I was not an informer.  
我递给他一支香烟，他接受了。我冒险评论了一下道路的状况。既然发射台如此重要，并涉及大量交通，我不明白为什么没有修一条像样的路。他说：“我们负担不起新路。我们请求参与这个项目的其他国家出资，但他们拒绝了。”他皱着眉头，斜眼瞥我，想看看我站在哪一边。我以一种模棱两可的语气说，这看起来确实不公平。“只是因为我们是个贫困的小国，他们一直在各方面都对我们不好。”他无法抑制住他的愤懑。“如果不是我们捐出了场地，发射台根本不可能在这里建成。他们应该记住，是我们让这一切成为可能。我们为公共利益牺牲了一块土地，却什么也没有得到回报。他们甚至不愿意派地面部队来帮助保护这个地方。正是他们的冷漠态度造成了这种不满。”他说话带着苦涩。我能感觉到他对大国的怨恨。“你是个外人……我不该对你说这些。”他焦虑地看着我，我向他保证我不是告密者。

Now that he had begun, he wanted to go on talking. I encouraged him to tell me about himself; it was the way to get him to speak of the things I was interested in. When the project first started, he had driven parties of workers along this road; they used to sing on the way. “You remember the old formula—‘all men of goodwill to unite in the task of world recovery and against the forces of destruction.’ They made the words into a sort of part song, men and women singing them together. It was inspiring to listen. We were all full of enthusiasm in those days. Now everything’s different.” I asked what had gone wrong. “Too many setbacks, delays, disappointments. The work would have been finished long ago if we’d had the materials. But everything had to come from abroad; from countries with different standards of measurement. Sometimes parts did not fit together; whole consignments had to go back. You can imagine the effect of such incidents on young enthusiasts, eager to get the job done.” It was the usual story of mistakes and muddles due to different ideologies, lack of direct contact. I thanked him for speaking frankly about these matters. A ball neatly volleyed, back bounced the cliché: “Contact between individuals is the first step toward a better understanding between peoples.”  
既然他已经开始了，他想继续聊下去。我鼓励他谈谈自己；这是让他谈起我感兴趣的话题的途径。项目刚开始时，他经常沿着这条路载着工人们前往工地；他们一路上还会唱歌。“你还记得那个老口号——‘所有善良的人团结起来，共同为世界复兴而努力，反对破坏的力量。’他们把这些话编成了一种合唱，男人和女人一起唱。听起来很鼓舞人心。那些日子里我们都充满了热情。现在一切都不同了。”我问出了什么问题。“太多的挫折、延误和失望。如果我们有足够的材料，工作早就完成了。但是一切都得从国外运来；那些国家的测量标准不一样。有时零件根本无法拼合在一起，整个批次的货物都得退回去。你可以想象这些事情对那些急于完成任务的年轻热心人有什么影响。”这通常是由于不同的意识形态和缺乏直接联系而造成的错误和混乱的故事。我感谢他坦率地谈论这些问题。一个老生常谈的话题被巧妙地引了回来：“人与人之间的接触是促进民族之间更好理解的第一步。”

I seemed to have won his confidence. He became quite friendly, told me about his girl, showed snapshots of her playing with a dog. I considered it unwise to let people know that I carried a sum of money, so drew his attention to something at the roadside while I quickly took out of my wallet the photograph I still kept there of the girl standing beside a lake. I showed it to him, saying that she had disappeared and that I was looking for her. Without any special feeling, he commented: “Wonderful hair. You’re in luck.” I asked rather sharply whether he would think himself lucky if his girl had vanished off the face of the earth, and he had the grace to look slightly embarrassed. I put the photo away, asked if he’d ever seen hair like that. “No, never.” He shook his head emphatically. “Most of our women are dark.” It was no use talking to him about her.  
我似乎赢得了他的信任。他变得相当友好，告诉我他的女朋友，并展示了她和一只狗玩耍的照片。我认为让人知道我身上带着一笔钱不太明智，于是趁他注意路边的时候，迅速从钱包里拿出我一直保存的那张照片，照片中是那个站在湖边的女孩。我把照片给他看，说她失踪了，我正在寻找她。他没有特别的情绪，只是评论道：“头发真漂亮。你真幸运。”我有些尖锐地问他，如果他的女朋友从地球上消失了，他还会觉得自己幸运吗，他勉强地露出了一丝尴尬的表情。我把照片收起来，问他是否见过像这样的头发。“没有，从未见过。”他坚定地摇了摇头。“我们这儿的大多数女人头发都很黑。”和他谈论她是没有用的。

We changed places. I was tired after my stint of driving and shut my eyes. When I opened them again he had a gun lying across his knees. I asked what he expected to shoot. “We’re getting near the frontier. It’s dangerous here. Enemies everywhere.” “But this country is neutral.” “What’s neutral? It’s just a word.” He added mysteriously: “Besides, there are various kinds of enemies.” “Such as?” “Saboteurs. Spies. Gangsters. All sorts of scoundrels who flourish in times of disorder.” I asked if he thought the lorry would be attacked. “It has happened. The stuff we’ve got on board is urgently needed. If they’ve got to hear about it they may try to stop us.”  
我们换了位置。我开了一段车，感到疲惫，闭上了眼睛。当我再次睁开眼时，他膝上放着一把枪。我问他预料会打什么。“我们快到边境了。这里很危险，到处都是敌人。”“但这个国家是中立的。”“中立？那不过是个词。”他神秘地补充道：“再说，还有各种各样的敌人。”“比如？”“破坏者，间谍，黑帮。各种在动乱时期猖獗的恶棍。”我问他是否认为卡车会被袭击。“这种事发生过。我们车上运载的东西是急需品。如果有人得知这个消息，他们可能会试图阻止我们。”

I brought out my automatic, saw him glancing at it with interest, evidently impressed by the foreign weapon. We had just entered the forest. He seemed nervous. “This is where the danger begins.” The tall trees had long gray beards of moss hanging down from their branches, forming opaque screens. It looked a good place to hide. The light was starting to fade, and what was left of it fell on the road, so that it was easy to imagine invisible eyes watching us. I kept a lookout for gunmen, but had other things on my mind.  
我掏出了我的自动手枪，看见他对这把外国武器露出感兴趣的神情，显然对它印象深刻。我们刚进入森林，他显得有些紧张。“危险就从这里开始。”高大的树木上垂挂着长长的灰色苔藓，形成不透明的帷幕，看起来是个很好的藏身之处。光线开始渐暗，剩余的光照在路上，使人很容易联想到有无形的眼睛在注视着我们。我警惕地留意着枪手，但脑子里还想着其他事情。

I spoke to the driver about the warden. He knew only what he had read in the newspapers. The distance to his headquarters from the transmitter was about twenty miles. “Can one go there?” “Go there?” He stared at me blankly. “Of course not. It’s enemy country. And they’ve destroyed the road, blocked the pass. There can’t be much of the town left, anyhow. We hear the guns pounding it at night.” He was more interested in reaching our destination in daylight. “We must get out of the forest before dark. We’ll just make it, with any luck.” He drove furiously, the lorry bounced and skidded over loose stones.  
我跟司机聊起了关于守卫者的事。他只知道一些从报纸上读来的信息。从发射台到他的总部大约有二十英里。“能去那里吗？”“去那里？”他茫然地瞪着我。“当然不能。那是敌人的地盘。而且他们已经毁了那条路，封锁了山口。那座城镇恐怕也所剩无几了。我们晚上能听到炮火在轰击那里。”他对在白天到达我们的目的地更感兴趣。“我们必须在天黑前离开这片森林。只要运气好，应该赶得上。”他开得飞快，卡车在松动的石头上颠簸和打滑。

I was too depressed to go on talking. The situation was hopeless. I needed the girl, could not live without her. But I should never be able to find her. There was no road to the town, I should never get there, it was impossible. In any case, the place was under constant bombardment and must have been destroyed. There was no object in going there. She had either left or been killed long ago. I felt in despair. I seemed to have come all this way for nothing.  
我感到太沮丧，无法继续谈话。形势无望。我需要那个女孩，没有她我无法生活。但我永远找不到她。通往那座城镇的路已经没有了，我永远到不了那里，这是不可能的。况且，那地方一直在被炮轰，恐怕早已被毁。没有任何理由去那里。她要么已经离开，要么早已被杀。我感到绝望。我似乎是白白走了这一趟。

The site for the transmitter had been carefully chosen, high up, surrounded by forest, backed by mountains, an easy place to defend against ground attack. They had cleared the area immediately round the installation, but the trees were not far away. We lived in prefabricated buildings that let in the rain. Everything felt damp to the touch. The floors were concrete, always covered in mud. Everywhere we walked became a morass. Everyone grumbled about the discomfort and the poor quality of the food.  
发射台的选址经过精心挑选，位于高地，四周环绕着森林，背靠山脉，易于防御地面攻击。他们清理了设备周围的区域，但树木并不远。我们住在预制的建筑里，雨水会渗进来，所有的东西摸起来都湿漉漉的。地面是混凝土，总是覆满了泥。我们走到哪里，哪里就变成了沼泽。每个人都在抱怨这里的恶劣环境和糟糕的食物。

Something had gone wrong with the weather. It should have been hot, dry, sunny; instead it rained all the time, there was a dank chill in the air. Thick white mists lay entangled in the tops of the forest trees; the sky was a perpetually steaming cauldron of cloud. The forest creatures were disturbed, and departed from their usual habits. The big cats lost their fear of man, came up to the buildings, prowled round the transmitter; strange unwieldy birds flopped overhead. I got the impression that birds and animals were seeking us out for protection against the unknown danger we had unloosed. The abnormalities in their behavior seemed ominous.  
天气出了问题。原本应该是炎热、干燥、阳光明媚的；但实际上却总是下雨，空气中弥漫着潮湿的寒意。浓厚的白雾缠绕在森林的树梢上；天空如同一个永远冒着蒸汽的云锅。森林里的生物受到了惊扰，改变了它们的习性。大型猫科动物不再害怕人类，走到建筑物前，徘徊在发射台周围；奇怪而笨重的鸟儿在头顶笨拙地飞来飞去。我感觉到这些鸟兽是在寻找我们，以求在我们释放的未知危险面前寻求庇护。它们异常的行为似乎预示着不祥之兆。

To pass the time and for want of something better to do, I organized the work on the transmitter. It was not far from completion, but the workers had grown discouraged and apathetic. I assembled them and spoke of the future. The belligerents would listen and be impressed by the impartial accuracy of our reports. The soundness of our arguments would convince them. Peace would be restored. Danger of universal conflict averted. This was to be the final reward of their labors. In the meantime, I divided them into teams, arranged competitions, awarded prizes to those who worked best. Soon we were ready to start broadcasting. I recorded events on both sides with equal respect for truth, put out programs on world peace, urged an immediate ceasefire. The minister wrote, congratulating me on my work.  
为了打发时间，也因为没有更好的事情可做，我组织了发射台的工作。工程离完成已经不远了，但工人们却渐渐失去了动力和热情。我把他们集合起来，谈论未来。交战双方会倾听我们的报道，并对我们公正准确的报告印象深刻。我们有理有据的论点会让他们信服。和平将得以恢复，普遍冲突的危险会被避免。这将是他们努力的最终回报。同时，我将他们分成小组，安排比赛，奖励那些表现最好的工人。很快，我们准备好开始广播了。我对双方的事件进行了记录，并以同样尊重事实的态度报道，播出了关于世界和平的节目，呼吁立即停火。部长写信来，对我的工作表示祝贺。

I could not make up my mind whether to cross the frontier or to stay where I was. I did not think the girl could be alive in the demolished town. If she had been killed there it was pointless to go. If she was safe somewhere else there was no point in going either. Considerable personal risk was involved. Although a non-combatant, I was liable to be shot as a spy, or imprisoned indefinitely.  
我无法决定是越过边境，还是留在原地。我认为那个女孩不可能还活在被摧毁的城镇。如果她已经在那里遇难，那么前去寻找毫无意义。如果她在别处安全无虞，去那里也同样没有意义。此行涉及相当大的个人风险。尽管我不是战斗人员，但我可能会被当作间谍处决，或者被无限期监禁。

But I was becoming tired of the work here now that everything was running smoothly. I was tired of trying to keep dry in the perpetual rain, tired of waiting to be overtaken by ice. Day by day the ice was creeping over the curve of the earth, unimpeded by seas or mountains. Without haste or pause, it was steadily moving nearer, entering and flattening cities, filling craters from which boiling lava had poured. There was no way of stopping the icy giant battalions, marching in relentless order across the world, crushing, obliterating, destroying everything in their path.  
但是，随着一切步入正轨，我开始厌倦这里的工作。我厌倦了在永不停歇的雨中努力保持干燥，厌倦了等待冰雪的侵袭。冰川日复一日地沿着地球的曲线蔓延，海洋和山脉都无法阻挡。它不紧不慢，毫不停歇，稳步逼近，进入城市，压平它们，填满了喷出滚烫岩浆的火山口。没有办法阻止这些巨大的冰川军团，它们无情地在世界各地推进，碾压、抹去、摧毁一切阻挡它们前进的事物。

I made up my mind to go. Without telling anyone, in the drenching rain, I drove to the blocked pass, and from there found my way over the tree-covered mountains on foot. I had only a pocket compass to guide me. It took me several hours of climbing and struggling through wet vegetation to reach the frontier station, where I was detained by the guard.  
我下定决心要走。没告诉任何人，在倾盆大雨中，我开车到达了被封锁的山口，从那里徒步翻越了树木覆盖的山脉。我的唯一指引是一个口袋里的指南针。我花了好几个小时在湿漉漉的植被中攀爬和挣扎，终于到达了边境哨站，在那里我被守卫拘留了。
