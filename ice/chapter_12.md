## TWELVE

The news I heard during the flight confirmed my worst fears. The world situation seemed to be entering its last fatal phase. The elimination of many countries, including my own, left no check on the militarism of the remaining big powers, who confronted each other, the smaller nations dividing allegiance between them. Both principals held stocks of nuclear weapons many times in excess of the overkill stage, so that the balance of terror appeared to be nicely adjusted. But some of the lesser countries also possessed thermonuclear devices, although which of them was not known: and this uncertainty, and the resulting tension, provoked escalating crises, each of which brought nearer the final catastrophe. An insane impatience for death was driving mankind to a second suicide, even before the full effect of the first had been felt. I was profoundly depressed, left with a sense of waiting for something frightful to happen, a sort of mass execution.  
在飞行途中听到的新闻证实了我最糟糕的担忧。世界局势似乎正在进入最后的致命阶段。包括我所在国家在内的许多国家的消亡，使剩下的大国毫无制约，彼此对峙，而小国则在它们之间分裂忠诚。两大主导国持有的核武器储备远远超过了毁灭性的程度，以至于恐怖的平衡看似精妙地调整好了。然而，一些小国也拥有热核装置，但哪些国家拥有却不为人知：这种不确定性和随之而来的紧张局势，引发了不断升级的危机，每一次危机都将最终的灾难推得更近。人类在感受到第一次自杀的全部影响之前，就因一种疯狂的死亡渴望而被驱使着走向第二次自杀。我深感沮丧，仿佛在等待着某种可怕的事情发生，一种集体处决的感觉。

I looked at the natural world, and it seemed to share my feelings, to be trying in vain to escape its approaching doom. The waves of the sea sped in disorderly flight toward the horizon; the sea birds, the dolphins and flying fish, hurtled frenziedly through the air; the islands trembled and grew transparent, endeavoring to detach themselves, to rise as vapor and vanish in space. But no escape was possible. The defenseless earth could only lie waiting for its destruction, either by avalanches of ice, or by chain-explosions which would go on and on, eventually transforming it into a nebula, its very substance disintegrated.  
我看着大自然，仿佛它也感受到了我的情绪，徒劳地试图逃离那即将来临的厄运。海浪无序地向地平线奔涌；海鸟、海豚和飞鱼疯狂地在空中穿梭；岛屿颤抖着，变得透明，努力想要脱离，升华为蒸汽，消失在太空中。然而，逃脱是不可能的。无助的地球只能静静等待它的毁灭，要么被冰雪的崩塌所吞噬，要么被连锁的爆炸不断摧毁，最终变成一片星云，它的本质彻底瓦解。

I went through the jungle alone, searching for the Indris, believing their magic influence might lift the dead weight of depression which had fallen on me. I did not care whether I saw or dreamed them. It was hot, steamy; the mad intensity of the sun pouring down all its force on the equator for the last time. My head was aching, I was exhausted: unable to stand the burning sun any longer, I lay down in black shade, shut my eyes.  
我独自穿过丛林，寻找印度支那狐猴，相信它们的神秘力量也许能驱散笼罩在我心头的沉重抑郁。我不在乎是看到它们还是梦见它们。天气炎热，蒸汽弥漫；仿佛是太阳最后一次将全部力量倾泻在赤道上，狂暴而炽烈。我的头痛欲裂，疲惫不堪：无法再忍受灼热的阳光，我躺在漆黑的阴影中，闭上了眼睛。

At once I felt that the lemurs were near me. Or was it their nearness that abolished despair and dread? It seemed more as if I received a message of hope from another world; a world without violence or cruelty, in which despair was unknown. I had often dreamed of this place, where life was a thousand times more exciting and splendid than life on earth. Now one of its inhabitants seemed to stand beside me. He smiled at me, touched my hand, spoke my name. His face was calm and impartial, tunelessly intelligent, full of goodwill, impossible to associate with any form of pretense.  
我立刻感到狐猴就在我身边。或者，是它们的存在驱散了绝望和恐惧？这更像是我从另一个世界收到了希望的信息；一个没有暴力或残忍的世界，一个绝望无从存在的地方。我经常梦见这个地方，那里生活的精彩与辉煌是地球上的千倍。现在，那个世界的一个居民似乎站在我身旁。他对我微笑，触碰我的手，叫出我的名字。他的脸庞平静而公正，透着一种超然的智慧，充满了善意，无法与任何形式的伪装联系起来。

He told me about the hallucination of space-time, and the joining of past and future so that either could be the present, and all ages accessible. He said he would take me to his world, if I wanted to go. He and others like him had seen the end of our planet, the end of the human race. The race was dying, the collective death-wish, the fatal impulse to self-destruction, although perhaps human life might survive. The life here was over. But life was continuing and expanding in a different place. We could be incorporated in this wider life, if we chose.  
他告诉我关于时空幻觉的事情，以及过去和未来的交汇，使它们都能成为现在，所有时代都触手可及。他说，如果我愿意，他会带我去他的世界。他和其他像他一样的人已经看到了我们星球的终结，人类的灭亡。人类正在走向灭亡，集体的死亡愿望，那致命的自我毁灭冲动，虽然人类生命可能会存活。这里的生命已经结束。但生命在另一个地方继续并扩展。如果我们愿意，可以融入这种更广泛的生命。

I tried to understand. He was a man, but seemed more; he was not what I was. He had access to superior knowledge, to some ultimate truth. He was offering me the freedom of his privileged world, a world my inmost self longed to know. I felt the excitement of the unimaginable experience. From the doomed dying world man had ruined, I seemed to catch sight of this other one, new, infinitely alive, and of boundless potential. For a second I believed myself capable of existing on a higher level in that wonderful world; but saw how far it was beyond my powers when I thought of the girl, the warden, the spreading ice, the fighting and killing. I was part of all that, irrevocably involved with events and persons upon this planet. It was heartbreaking to reject what a part of me wanted most. But I knew that my place was here, in our world under sentence of death, and that I would have to stay and see it through to the end.  
我努力理解。他是个人，但似乎不止如此；他不是我所是的。他接触到更高的知识，一些终极的真理。他向我提供了进入他那特权世界的自由，一个我的内心深处渴望了解的世界。我感受到了一种无法想象的体验带来的兴奋。从被人类毁坏的注定要消亡的世界中，我似乎瞥见了另一个新的、充满无限生机和无限潜力的世界。有那么一瞬间，我相信自己能够在那个美妙的世界中以更高的层次存在；但当我想到那个女孩、看守、扩散的冰雪、战争与杀戮时，意识到它是多么遥不可及。我是这一切的一部分，不可避免地与这个星球上的事件和人群纠缠在一起。放弃那一部分我最想要的东西是令人心碎的。但我知道，我的归宿在这里，在这个被判死刑的世界，我必须留下来，直面直到终结。

The dream, the hallucination, or whatever it was, had a powerful effect on me afterward. I could not forget it, could not forget the supreme intelligence and integrity of that dream-face. I was left with a sense of emptiness, loss, as if something precious really had been in my grasp, and I had thrown it away.  
梦境、幻觉，或无论那是什么，在事后对我产生了强烈的影响。我无法忘记它，无法忘记那个梦中面孔所展现的卓越智慧与诚挚。我感到一阵空虚和失落，仿佛真的曾握住过某种珍贵的东西，而我却将它抛弃了。

It did not seem to matter what I did now. I was committed to violence and must keep to my pattern. I managed to reach the mainland where guerrilla fighting was going on, and, indifferent to everything, joined a company of mercenaries in the pay of the west. We fought in the marshes, in the delta of a tidal river with many mouths, thigh-deep in mud most of the time. More men had been lost in the mud than through enemy action when finally we were withdrawn. It seemed to me we were fighting against the ice, which was all the while coming steadily nearer, covering more of the world with its dead silence, its awful white peace. By making war we asserted the fact that we were alive and opposed the icy death creeping over the globe.  
我现在做什么似乎并不重要。我致力于暴力，必须遵守我的模式。我设法到达了正在进行游击战的大陆，对一切都漠不关心，加入了一支接受西方雇佣的雇佣兵连。我们在沼泽地、潮汐河流的三角洲里作战，那里有很多河口，大部分时间都深陷在大腿深的泥浆里。当我们最终撤退时，在泥浆中丧生的人数比在敌人行动中丧生的人数还要多。在我看来，我们似乎是在与冰作斗争，冰一直在稳步逼近，用死一般的寂静、可怕的白色和平覆盖着世界的更多地方。通过发动战争，我们宣告了我们还活着的事实，并反对冰冷的死亡在全球蔓延。

I still felt I was waiting for something fearful to happen, but in a curious sort of suspended state. There was an emotional blockage. I recognized it in others besides myself. In suppressing food riots, our machine guns indiscriminately cut down rioters and harmless pedestrians. I had no feeling about it and noticed the same indifference in everyone else. People stood looking on as at a performance, did not even attend to the wounded. I had to share a sleeping tent with five other men for a time. They had fantastic courage, but no idea of danger, of life, death, anything; were satisfied as long as they got a hot meal every day with meat and potatoes. I could not make any contact with them; hung up my overcoat as a screen and lay sleepless behind it.  
我依然感到自己在等待着某种可怕的事情发生，但却处于一种奇怪的悬浮状态中。情感上有一种阻塞感。我发现不仅我自己，还有其他人也有这种情况。在镇压食品暴动时，我们的机关枪会毫不区分地扫射暴民和无辜的行人。我对此毫无感觉，也注意到其他人同样冷漠。人们站在一旁看着，像看表演一样，并未关心受伤者。有一段时间我不得不与其他五个人共用一个睡帐篷。他们拥有惊人的勇气，但对危险、生命和死亡一无所知；只要每天能吃到热乎的肉和土豆，他们就心满意足。我无法与他们建立任何联系；我把大衣挂起来当作屏幕，躺在它后面辗转难眠。

Presently I began to hear the warden mentioned again. He was attached to western headquarters, held an important post there. I remembered his wish to cooperate with the big powers, and admired the way he had achieved it. Thinking of him made me restless. It seemed idiotic to spend my last days in a hired fighting unit, and I decided to ask him to find me a job in which I would have more scope. The problem was how to reach him. Our leader was the only person who occasionally had direct dealings with the higher command, and he refused to help me, interested in nothing but his own advancement. For days we had been attacking a strongly defended building said to contain secret papers. He would not ask for reinforcements, determined to get the credit for taking the place unaided. By a simple trick, I enabled him to capture the building and send the documents to headquarters, for which he was highly praised.  
不久后，我再次听到有人提到典狱长。他现在被调到西部总部，担任一个重要职位。我记得他曾希望与大国合作，并且我钦佩他成功实现了这一愿望。想到他让我感到不安，临死前待在一个雇佣的战斗部队里简直愚蠢。我决定请他为我找一份更有发展空间的工作。问题是如何联系上他。我们的领导是唯一一个偶尔与上级直接接触的人，但他拒绝帮助我，只关心自己的升迁。我们连续几天进攻一个据说藏有机密文件的防守严密的建筑。他不愿请求援军，执意要独自夺下建筑以获得功劳。通过一个简单的计谋，我帮助他成功占领了那座建筑，并将文件送往总部，为此他受到了高度赞扬。

Impressed by my ingenuity, he asked me to have a drink with him, offered me promotion. He was making a personal report the next day, and I said that the only reward I wanted was to go to headquarters with him. He replied that he couldn’t spare me, I must give him more of these tips. He was half drunk. I deliberately encouraged him to go on drinking until he passed out. In the morning, when he was about to start, I jumped into his car, pretending he had promised to take me, relying on his having been too drunk the previous night to remember what had been said. It was a nasty moment. He clearly suspected something. But he did not have me thrown out of the car. I drove with him to headquarters, neither of us speaking a word the whole way.  
他对我的机智印象深刻，邀请我与他共饮，并向我提供晋升机会。第二天他要做个人报告，我告诉他我唯一想要的报酬就是和他一起去总部。他回答说不能放我走，我得继续给他这些建议。他已经半醉，我故意鼓励他继续喝，直到他醉倒。第二天早上，当他准备出发时，我跳进了他的车，假装他答应带我走，心想他昨晚醉得太厉害，应该记不起之前说过的话。那一刻非常尴尬，他显然有所怀疑。但他没有把我赶下车。一路上我们都没有说话，我和他一起驱车前往总部。
