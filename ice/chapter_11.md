## ELEVEN

The gay, undamaged town, full of light and color, freedom, the absence of danger, the warm sun. The faces were happy. The sense of escape brought euphoria. The past was forgotten, the long, hard, dangerous voyage and the preceding nightmare. Nothing but the nightmare had seemed real while it was going on, as if the other lost world had been imagined or dreamed. Now that world, no longer lost, was here the one solid reality. There were theaters, cinemas, restaurants and hotels, shops where goods of all sorts were sold freely, without coupons. The contrast was staggering. The relief overwhelming. The reaction too great. A kind of delirium was induced, a mad gaiety. People sang and danced in the streets, strangers embraced one another. The whole town was decorated as for a festival: flowers everywhere, Chinese lanterns and fairy lights strung from trees, buildings floodlit, elaborate arrangements of colored lights in the parks and gardens. The throb of dance music never stopped. Every night firework displays. All night long fiery stars and rockets burst in the sky, and sank reflected in the dark harbor. The festivities went on and on: carnivals, battles of flowers, balls, regattas, concerts, processions. Nobody wanted to be reminded of what was happening in other parts of the world. Rumors coming from outside were suppressed by order of the consul, who had assumed responsibility for the maintenance of law and order, “pending the restoration of the status quo.” To speak of the catastrophe was an offense under the new regulations. The rule was to choose not to know.  
繁华而未受损的城镇，充满了光彩和色彩，自由、无危机、阳光温暖。人们的脸上洋溢着幸福。逃离的感觉带来了欢欣雀跃。过去的困苦、危险的航程和之前的噩梦都被遗忘了。那段经历时，只有噩梦是真实的，仿佛另一个丢失的世界是想象或梦境。现在，这个不再丢失的世界成为了唯一的实在。这里有剧院、电影院、餐馆和酒店，各种商品在商店里自由出售，无需配给券。巨大的反差令人惊愕，巨大的解脱令人陶醉，产生了一种狂喜，一种疯狂的欢愉。人们在街上唱歌跳舞，陌生人互相拥抱。整个城市像在过节，到处都是花朵、悬挂的中式灯笼和彩灯，建筑物被照亮，公园和花园里有精心布置的彩灯。舞曲的节奏从未停止。每晚都有烟火表演。整夜，燃烧的星星和火箭在天空中炸裂，然后倒映在黑暗的港口中。庆祝活动接连不断：狂欢节、花卉大战、舞会、帆船赛、音乐会、游行。没有人愿意被其他地方的事情所打扰。从外界传来的谣言被领事下令封锁，他承担了维护法律和秩序的责任，“等待恢复原状。”在新的规定下，谈论灾难是违法的。选择不知晓成为了新的法则。

Remembering how I myself had wished to forget on another occasion, I understood the euphoric blindness without condoning it. I did not take part in the general rejoicing; I did not feel gay. I had no wish to spend my time dancing or looking at fireworks. Very soon I was utterly sick of bands playing and people in fancy dress. The girl loved all the gaiety, was absolutely transformed by it, her life miraculously renewed. Her weakness and lassitude vanished, she rushed to the shops, bought clothes and cosmetics extravagantly, visited hairdressers, beauty parlors. She seemed a different person. No longer shy, she made friends with people I did not know, drew confidence from their approval, became independent and gay. I scarcely saw anything of her; most of the time I had no idea where she was. She came to me only when she needed money, which I always gave her. For me it was an unsatisfactory situation. I wanted to end it.  
回想起我自己曾经也想要在某个时刻遗忘一切，我理解这种陶醉的盲目却不赞同。我没有参与到普遍的欢庆中；我并不感到欢乐。我没有兴趣花时间跳舞或观看烟火表演。很快，我对乐队演奏和人们穿着奇装异服的景象感到极度厌烦。女孩却喜爱所有的欢乐景象，她被完全改变了，生活似乎奇迹般地重焕生机。她的虚弱和倦怠消失了，兴冲冲地逛商店，奢侈地买衣服和化妆品，去美发沙龙和美容院。她似乎变成了另一个人。不再羞怯，她与我不认识的人交朋友，从他们的认可中获得信心，变得独立而开朗。我几乎见不到她；大部分时间我都不知道她在哪里。她只有在需要钱的时候才来找我，我总是给她。对我来说，这种情况让人难以满意。我希望尽快结束这一切。

I could not remain isolated from the rest of the world. I was involved with the fate of the planet, I had to take an active part in whatever was going on. The endless celebrations here seemed both boring and sinister, reminiscent of the orgies of the plague years. Now, as then, people were deluding themselves; they induced a false sense of security by means of self-indulgence and wishful thinking. I did not believe for one moment they had really escaped.  
我无法与世隔绝。我的命运与地球的命运息息相关，我必须积极参与正在发生的一切。这里无休止的庆祝活动既令人厌倦又显得阴森，仿佛是瘟疫年代的狂欢重现。如今，人们依然在自欺欺人；通过放纵和幻想，他们营造出一种虚假的安全感。我从未相信他们真的逃脱了。

I observed the weather carefully; it was fine and warm, but not warm enough. I noted particularly how the temperature fell after sunset, producing a definite chill. It was a bad sign. If I mentioned it, I was told this was the cool season. All the same, the sun should have had more power. Looking about, I found other signs of a changing climate. Plants in the tropical gardens were starting to look unhealthy, and I asked a man working there why this was. He gave me a suspicious glance, mumbled an evasive answer: when I persisted, he pretended to hear the head gardener calling, and ran away. I commented on the chilly evenings to some townspeople I saw going about in peculiar wrappings. They were obviously unused to even this mild degree of cold, and possessed no suitable clothing. They too answered evasively and looked at me in alarm. In view of the new regulations, they probably took me for an agent provocateur.  
我仔细观察了天气；虽然晴朗而温暖，但却不够暖和。我特别注意到日落后温度明显下降，带来了一丝寒意。这是一个不好的迹象。当我提到这一点时，人们告诉我这是凉爽的季节。然而，太阳本该更有威力。我环顾四周，发现了气候变化的其他迹象。热带花园里的植物开始显得不健康，我问一个在那里工作的男人为什么会这样。他疑惑地看了我一眼，含糊其辞地回答：当我坚持追问时，他假装听到园艺师在叫他，跑开了。我对一些穿着奇怪裹布的镇民们提起傍晚的寒冷。他们显然对这种轻微的寒冷不习惯，也没有合适的衣物应对。他们的回答也很含糊，并警惕地看着我。考虑到新的规定，他们很可能认为我是个挑拨离间的人。

An acquaintance of mine, employed in an official capacity by his government, stopped to refuel his plane. I made contact with him, questioned him about events elsewhere. He was uncommunicative. I understood the reason and did not press him. He could not be certain of my affiliations. Mistakes were not tolerated. An absolute standard of loyalty was demanded. The speaker of an incautious phrase would be eliminated, given no chance to correct an error of judgment. Somewhat reluctantly, he agreed to take me as a passenger when he left, but only as far as another island in the archipelago. I saw on the map that the island inhabited by the Indris was not far away, and, although I had decided to go back to my old profession, I promised myself a short visit to the lemurs before proceeding to the theater of military operations.  
我的一位熟人，受雇于政府，负责公务事务，他停下来给飞机加油。我和他联系了，询问其他地方的情况。他对我很冷淡。我理解其中的原因，也没有继续追问。他无法确定我的身份所属。错误是不能容忍的，要求绝对的忠诚。冒失地说一句话的人会被消灭，没有机会纠正判断错误。他有些不情愿地同意在离开时带我作为乘客，但只能到群岛中的另一个岛屿。我在地图上看到，Indris栖息的岛屿离那里不远，虽然我决定回到原来的职业，但我答应自己在去军事行动的战场之前，先短暂拜访这些狐猴。

I went to inform the girl of my plans. Earlier in the day, waiting to cross a street, I had been held up while a procession went past. She was at its head, standing beside the driver of a big open car decorated with Parma violets. She did not see me, she had no reason to look. Her hair shone like pale fire in the sun, she was smiling and throwing violets to the crowd. It was hard to recognize her as the girl who had traveled with me. When I entered her room, she was still wearing the same Parma violet dress; the delicate color suited her fragile paleness, she looked extremely attractive. Her sparkling hair, sprinkled with silver and Parma violets, had been touched with a matching dye; the slight touch of fantasy was especially charming.  
我去告诉她我的计划。早些时候，在等待过马路时，我被一场游行队伍阻挡住了。她在队伍的前面，站在一辆装饰着帕尔马紫罗兰的大敞篷车旁边。她没有看到我，也没有理由去看我。她的头发在阳光下像淡淡的火焰般闪耀，她微笑着，把紫罗兰花抛向人群。我几乎认不出她是那个曾与我同行的女孩。当我走进她的房间时，她还穿着同样的帕尔马紫罗兰色的裙子；这种细腻的颜色与她的苍白肤色非常相配，她看起来非常迷人。她那闪耀的头发点缀着银丝和紫罗兰花，还染上了与之相配的颜色；这种微妙的幻想色彩尤其动人。

Telling her to open it later, I presented her with a small package containing a bracelet she had admired, and a check on my personal account. “I’ve brought you some good news, too. I’ve come to say good-bye.” She looked disconcerted, asked what I meant. “I’m leaving tonight. By plane. Aren’t you pleased?” As she only stared silently, I went on: “You’ve always wanted to get rid of me. You must be glad I’m going at last.” A pause, then her voice, cold, resentful. “What do you expect me to say?” I was puzzled by this reaction. She continued to survey me coldly, asked with sudden bitterness: “What sort of a man do you think you are?” The tone was meant to be scathing. “Now perhaps you see why I’ve never trusted you. I always knew you’d betray me again . . . go off and leave me, just as you did before.” I protested: “That’s grossly unfair! You can’t blame me for going after you’ve told me to go, made it completely clear that you’ve no time for me—I’ve hardly set eyes on you since we got here.” “Oh . . . !” With a disgusted exclamation, she turned her back, took a few steps away from me.  


The full skirt swirling, a silky shimmer like moonlight on violets; the bright, heavy hair swinging, scintillating with violet highlights. I followed, touched her hair with the tips of my fingers, felt it ripple with life. Her arms had a soft satin sheen, the skin smooth and scented, a chain of violets round the thin wrist. I put my arms round her and kissed her neck. Instantly her whole body tensed in violent resistance, she twisted herself away. “Don’t touch me! I don’t know how you have the nerve . . .” Her voice seemed to fail on the edge of tears, then rose again thinly: “Well, what are you waiting for? Why don’t you go? And don’t come back this time. I never want to see you again, or be reminded of you!” She pulled off her watch and a ring I had given her, flung them wildly in my direction; began trying to unfasten her necklace, hands at the back of her head, the raised arms giving her slight body a hint of voluptuousness it did not really possess. With an effort I refrained from embracing her again, pleaded with her instead. “Don’t be so angry. Don’t let’s part like this. You must know how I’ve felt about you all this time. You know how I’ve always followed you, forced you to come with me. But you’ve said so consistently that you hated me, wanted nothing to do with me, that I’ve finally had to believe you.” I was only being half honest, and knew it. Tentatively I took her hand; it was stiff, unresponsive, but she did not take it away, let me go on holding it while she gazed at me fixedly. With doubt, criticism, accusation her eyes rested . . . serious, innocent, shadowed eyes; the hand behind her head still engaged with the necklace; the glittering hair, the scent of violets, close to my hand; then the grave voice . . . “And if I hadn’t said those things, would you have stayed with me?”  
我递给她一个小包，里面装着她曾欣赏过的一条手链，还有一张我的个人支票，并告诉她稍后再打开。“我还带来了一个好消息，我是来跟你道别的。”她显得不安，问我是什么意思。“我今晚就要走了，坐飞机。你难道不高兴吗？”她只是沉默地盯着我，我接着说：“你一直想摆脱我。你一定很高兴我终于要走了。”停顿了一下，她的声音冷冷的，带着怨恨。“你希望我说什么？”她的反应让我感到困惑。她继续冷冷地打量着我，突然带着苦涩问道：“你觉得你是什么样的人？”语气带着尖刻的嘲讽。“现在你或许明白为什么我从未信任你。我一直知道你会再次背叛我……像之前那样离开我。”我抗议道：“这太不公平了！你不能因为我在你告诉我离开、明确表示你不需要我之后就离开而责备我——自从我们到这里以来，我几乎都没看到你。”她厌恶地轻哼一声，转过身去，走开了几步。

This time it seemed important to speak the whole truth: but I could not be certain what that was, and in the end the only true words seemed to be: “I don’t know.”  
这一次，说出全部真相似乎尤为重要，但我无法确定那是什么，最终，唯一真实的话语似乎只有：“我不知道。”

Immediately she became furious, tore her hand out of mine; the other hand tugged at the chain round her neck, broke it, beads shot all over the room. “How can you be so utterly heartless—and so brazen about it! Anyone else would be ashamed . . . but you . . . you don’t even pretend to have any feelings . . . it’s too horrible, hateful . . . you simply aren’t human at all!” I was sorry, I had not wanted to hurt her: I could understand her indignation, in a way. There seemed nothing that I could say. My silence enraged her still more. “Oh, go on! Go away! Go!” She turned on me suddenly, pushed me with a force for which I was unprepared, so that I stumbled back, ran my elbow into the door. It was painful, and I asked in annoyance: “Why are you so anxious to get me out of the room? Are you expecting somebody else? The owner of that open car you were in?” “Oh, how I loathe and despise you! If only you knew how much!” She pushed me again. “Get out, can’t you? Go, go, go!” She took a deep breath, lunged at me, started pounding my chest with her fists. But the effort was too much, she abandoned it at once and leaned against the wall, her head drooping. I saw that her shadowed face looked bruised by emotion, before the bright hair swung forward, concealing it. There was a brief pause, long enough for me to feel a chilly sensation creep over me; the adumbration of emptiness, loss . . . of what life would be like without her.  
她立刻变得愤怒无比，猛地把手从我手中抽回，另一只手拽着脖子上的链子，猛地一扯，珠子四散落满了房间。“你怎么能这么无情，还如此厚颜无耻！任何其他人都会感到羞愧……但你……你连假装有感情都不屑……这太可怕了，太令人憎恶了……你根本就不是人！”我感到抱歉，我并不想伤害她：在某种程度上，我理解她的愤怒。我似乎什么也说不出来，我的沉默让她更加恼怒。“哦，继续吧！走开！走！”她突然转身推了我一把，我没有准备好，踉跄后退，肘部撞到了门上，疼痛让我不满地问道：“你为什么这么急着让我离开房间？你在等别人吗？你坐的那辆敞篷车的主人？”“哦，我多么痛恨你、鄙视你！你知道那有多深吗？”她再次推了我一把。“滚出去，你不会吗？走，走，走！”她深吸一口气，猛地扑向我，开始用拳头捶打我的胸膛。但这太费劲了，她立刻放弃了，靠在墙上，头低垂着。我看到她阴影下的脸因为情绪的冲击显得伤痕累累，接着她亮丽的头发垂了下来，遮住了她的脸。短暂的停顿，足够让我感受到一种冰冷的感觉蔓延过来，那是一种空虚、失落的预感……那就是没有她的生活会是什么样的。

Action was needed to drive away this unpleasant feeling. I put my hand on the door knob, and said, “All right; I’ll go now,” half hoping to be detained at the last moment. She did not move or speak, made no sign. Only, as I opened the door, a funny little sound escaped from her throat; a sob, a choke, a cough, I could not tell which. I went out into the passage, walked quickly past all the closed doors, back to my own room.  
必须采取行动来驱散这种不愉快的感觉。我把手放在门把手上，说道：“好吧；我现在就走，”内心半希望在最后一刻被挽留。她没有动，也没有说话，没有任何表示。只是，当我打开门时，她的喉咙里发出了一个奇怪的小声音；是一声呜咽，一声哽咽，还是一声咳嗽，我分辨不清。我走到过道上，快步走过所有紧闭的门，回到自己的房间。

There was still a little time left. I rang for a bottle of Scotch and sat drinking. I felt uncertain, divided in myself. My bag was already packed and had been taken downstairs. In a few minutes I would have to follow . . . unless I changed my plans, stayed here after all . . . I remembered that I had not said good-bye, wondered whether to go back, could not make up my mind. I was still undecided when it was time to go.  
还有一点时间。我叫了一瓶苏格兰威士忌，坐下开始喝。我感到不确定，内心充满矛盾。我的行李已经打包好，并被拿到楼下。几分钟后，我就得跟过去……除非我改变计划，最终还是留下……我想起还没有道别，犹豫着是否要回去，却拿不定主意。到该走的时候，我仍然举棋不定。

I had to pass her door again on the way down. I hesitated outside it for a second, then hurried on to the lift. Of course I was leaving. Only a madman would waste this almost miraculous chance of getting away. I could not possibly hope for another.  
下楼时，我又不得不经过她的房门。我在门外犹豫了一秒，然后匆匆走向电梯。我当然要离开。只有疯子才会浪费这几乎是奇迹般的逃离机会。我不可能再奢望有第二次机会。
