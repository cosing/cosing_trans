## ONE

I was lost, it was already dusk, I had been driving for hours and was practically out of petrol. The idea of being stranded on these lonely hills in the dark appalled me, so I was glad to see a signpost, and coast down to a garage. When I opened a window to speak to the attendant, the air outside was so cold that I turned up my collar. While he was filling the tank he commented on the weather. “Never known such cold in this month. Forecast says we’re in for a real bad freeze-up.” Most of my life was spent abroad, soldiering, or exploring remote areas: but although I had just come from the tropics and freeze-ups meant little to me, I was struck by the ominous sound of his words. Anxious to get on, I asked the way to the village I was making for. “You’ll never find it in the dark, it’s right off the beaten track. And those hill roads are dangerous when they’re iced up.” He seemed to imply that only a fool would drive on under present conditions, which rather annoyed me. So, cutting short his involved directions, I paid him and drove away, ignoring his last warning shout: “Look out for that ice!”  
我迷路了，当时已是黄昏，我已经开了好几个小时的车，快要没油了。一想到我可能要困在这些孤独的丘壑中我就焦躁起来，所以当我看到一个标牌并开到一个车修理站里时我很高兴。当我打开车窗和接待员说话时，外面的空气冷到我得竖起我的衣领。但他在填满我的油箱时他抱怨了一下天气。“从没在这个月这么冷过。天气预报也说这是非常糟糕的寒潮。”我人生的大部分都是在国外度过的，当兵或者探索遥远的地区：但尽管我刚从热带过来并且寒潮对我来说不意味着什么，我还是被他的话中不祥的声音震撼到了。我焦急地想走，所以问了我想去的村庄的路。“你在黑暗中是找不到的，就在废弃的铁轨下面。而且山路结冰很危险。”他似乎想说只有傻瓜才会在这种情况下开车，这让我恼怒。所以我打断了他的指路，付了钱开走了，忽视了他最后呼喊的警告：“当心冰！”

It had got quite dark by now, and I was soon more hopelessly lost than ever. I knew I should have listened to the fellow, but at the same time wished I had not spoken to him at all. For some unknown reason, his remarks had made me uneasy; they seemed a bad omen for the whole expedition, and I began to regret having embarked on it.  
现在很暗了，我很快就在绝望中前所未有地迷路了。我知道我本该听从那家伙，但同时我又希望我从未和他说过话。出于某种未知的原因，他的发言让我不适；仿佛是对正常探险的一个不祥之兆，我开始后悔我遵从了这一凶兆。

I had been doubtful about the trip all along. I had arrived only the previous day, and should have been attending to things in town instead of visiting friends in the country. I myself did not understand my compulsion to see this girl, who had been in my thoughts all the time I was away, although she was not the reason for my return. I had come back to investigate rumors of a mysterious impending emergency in this part of the world. But as soon as I got here she became an obsession, I could think only of her, felt I must see her immediately, nothing else mattered. Of course I knew it was utterly irrational. And so was my present uneasiness: no harm was likely to come to me in my own country; and yet I was becoming more and more anxious as I drove on.  
我本来就对这场旅行充满怀疑。我前一天刚到，本该在镇里处理事务而不是到乡下拜访朋友。我自己都不理解我为什么这么想见到这个女孩，她在我离开的这段时间一直待在我的脑海中，虽然她不是我回来的原因。我回来是为了调查关于这部分世界迫近的神秘危机的一些传言。但我一到这里她就成了我的执念，我只能想她，想立即见到她，其他一切都无关紧要。当然我知道这非常不理智。我目前的不适也同样如此：我自己的国家对我没理由有任何危害；然而我开着开着就越来越觉得焦躁。

Reality had always been something of an unknown quantity to me. At times this could be disturbing. Now, for instance, I had visited the girl and her husband before, and kept a vivid recollection of the peaceful, prosperous-looking countryside round their home. But this memory was rapidly fading, losing its reality, becoming increasingly unconvincing and indistinct, as I passed no one on the road, never came to a village, saw no lights anywhere. The sky was black, blacker untended hedges towering against it; and when the headlights occasionally showed roadside buildings, these too were always black, apparently uninhabited and more or less in ruins. It was just as if the entire district had been laid waste during my absence.  
现实对我来说总是个未知数。有时候这是恼人的。现在，比方说，我拜访过这个女孩和她的丈夫，并且记得他们家附近的乡间平静又富饶。但这记忆迅速消散，失去其根基，变得越来越难以置信和模糊，此时我在路上没遇到任何人，没看到任何村子或者光亮。天空黑暗，无人打理的围栏耸立直指着天空；当车顶偶尔照到路边的楼时，那些楼也总是黑暗的，很明显没住人，或多或少荒废着。仿佛整个社区在我不在的时候都成了废墟。

I began to wonder if I would ever find her in the general disorder. It did not look as if any organized life could have been going on here since whatever disaster had obliterated the villages and wrecked the farms. As far as I could see, no attempt had been made to restore normality. No rebuilding or work on the land had been done, no animals were in the fields. The road badly needed repairs, the ditches were choked with weeds under the neglected hedges, the whole region appeared to have been left derelict and deserted.  
我开始怀疑我在这总体的混乱中可不可能找到她。看起来任何有序的生命都不会出现了，毕竟也许某种灾难摧毁了村子让农场荒废。就我所见，没人尝试过重回正常。地上没进行过任何重建工作，地里没有任何动物。道路急需修理，被忽视的围栏下野草堵住了沟渠，整个地方显然被放置和抛弃了。

A handful of small white stones hit the windscreen, making me jump. It was so long since I had experienced winter in the north that I failed to recognize the phenomenon. The hail soon turned to snow, diminishing visibility and making driving more difficult. It was bitterly cold, and I became aware of a connection between this fact and my increasing uneasiness. The garage man had said he had never known it so cold at this time, and my own impression was that it was far too early in the season for ice and snow. Suddenly my anxiety was so acute that I wanted to turn and drive back to town; but the road was too narrow, I was forced to follow its interminable windings up and down hill in the lifeless dark. The surface got worse, it got steeper and more slippery all the time. The unaccustomed cold made my head ache as I stared out, straining my eyes in the effort of trying to avoid icy patches, where the car skidded out of control. When the headlights fled over roadside ruins from time to time, the brief glimpse always surprised me, and vanished before I was sure I had really seen it.  
一些小白石头打在挡风玻璃上，让我跳起来。我很久没体验过北方的冬天了，我没能认出这种现象。冰雹很快变成了血，夺走了可见度也让驾驶更加困难。异常的冷，我意识到这和我越来越难以忍受的不适之间的联系。修理站的那个男人说他从未在这时见过这么冷的天，而在我印象中冰和雪来得太早了。突然我的焦虑变得如此严重以至于我想掉头开回镇里；但路太窄了，我被迫在无机的黑暗中跟从没有尽头的曲折上下的山丘。路面总是变得更加陡峭和湿滑。我不适应这冷，让我头疼，为了躲避冰面我的眼睛也干涸起来，车会在那里渐渐失去控制。当车灯时不时掠过路边的遗迹，惊鸿一瞥总是惊到我，在我确定我真的看到之前消失。

An unearthly whiteness began to bloom on the hedges. I passed a gap and glanced through. For a moment, my lights picked out like searchlights the girl’s naked body, slight as a child’s, ivory white against the dead white of the snow, her hair bright as spun glass. She did not look in my direction. Motionless, she kept her eyes fixed on the walls moving slowly toward her, a glassy, glittering circle of solid ice, of which she was the center. Dazzling flashes came from the ice-cliffs far over her head; below, the outermost fringes of ice had already reached her, immobilized her, set hard as concrete over her feet and ankles. I watched the ice climb higher, covering knees and thighs, saw her mouth open, a black hole in the white face, heard her thin, agonized scream. I felt no pity for her. On the contrary, I derived an indescribable pleasure from seeing her suffer. I disapproved of my own callousness, but there it was. Various factors had combined to produce it, although they were not extenuating circumstances.  
围栏上开始涌现古怪的白色。我经过一个沟向里面看去。一时间，我的车灯像探照灯一样找出一个女孩的裸体，纤细如孩童，对应着雪的死寂的白色是象牙的白色，她的头发像玻璃纤维一样明亮。她没有看向我。静止着，她盯着渐渐移向她的墙，那是玻璃状的闪亮亮的固体冰的圆圈，她在中心。耀眼的闪光从她头顶的高处的冰崖上袭来；在下面，最远的外围冰已经触及到她，定住她，在她的脚和踝上牢固如混凝土。我看着冰爬高，盖住膝盖和大腿，看着她的嘴大张着，白脸上一个黑洞，听着她轻微的痛苦的尖叫。我不同情她。相反，我对她的痛苦有种难以描述的愉悦。我斥责自己的残酷，但它确实存在。很多因素造就了它，虽然它们都不是脱罪的借口。

I had been infatuated with her at one time, had intended to marry her. Ironically, my aim then had been to shield her from the callousness of the world, which her timidity and fragility seemed to invite. She was over-sensitive, highly strung, afraid of people and life; her personality had been damaged by a sadistic mother who kept her in a permanent state of frightened subjection. The first thing I had to do was to win her trust, so I was always gentle with her, careful to restrain my feelings. She was so thin that, when we danced, I was afraid of hurting her if I held her tightly. Her prominent bones seemed brittle, the protruding wrist-bones had a particular fascination for me. Her hair was astonishing, silver-white, an albino’s, sparkling like moonlight, like moonlit venetian glass. I treated her like a glass girl; at times she hardly seemed real. By degrees she lost her fear of me, showed a childish affection, but remained shy and elusive. I thought I had proved to her that I could be trusted, and was content to wait. She seemed on the point of accepting me, although immaturity made it hard to assess the sincerity of her feelings. Her affection perhaps was not altogether pretense, although she deserted me suddenly for the man to whom she was now married.  
我一度为她痴迷，想娶她。讽刺的是，我本意是为了从世界的残酷中保护她，她的柔弱和脆弱似乎邀请着前者。她过度敏感、高度紧张，害怕人和生命；她的人格被肆虐的母亲毁灭了，后者让其永久处于恐惧的主观状态中。我要做的第一件事就是赢得她的信任，说我总是温柔对待她，小心地压制我的感受。她是如此地瘦，当我们跳舞时我害怕紧抱她会伤害她。她凸出的骨头似乎易碎，隆起的腕骨尤其吸引我。她的头发迷人，银白，白化病，像月光闪烁，仿佛月光下的威尼斯玻璃。我像对待玻璃女孩那样待她；有时她显得不真实。她多少不再害怕我，对我有种孩子气的依赖，但还是羞涩和难以企及。我以为我已经向她证明我能够被信任，并乐意等待。她似乎就要接受我了，虽然幼稚让她的感情真挚性难以评判。她的依赖也许不全是伪装，尽管她突然抛弃我去跟随她现在嫁给的这个男人。

This was past history. But the consequences of the traumatic experience were still evident in the insomnia and headaches from which I suffered. The drugs prescribed for me produced horrible dreams, in which she always appeared as a helpless victim, her fragile body broken and bruised. These dreams were not confined to sleep only, and a deplorable side effect was the way I had come to enjoy them.  
这都是过去了。但这一创伤性经历的后果在我承受的失眠和头痛中仍留存。医生为我开的药让我做噩梦，在梦里她总是无助的受害者，她脆弱的身体支离破碎充满淤青。这些梦不只是打扰睡眠，更糟糕的副作用是我如何享受它们。

Visibility had improved, the night was no less dark, but the snow had stopped. I could see the remains of a fort on the top of a steep hill. Nothing much was left of it but the tower, it had been gutted, empty window-holes showed like black open mouths. The place seemed vaguely familiar, a distortion of something I half remembered. I seemed to recognize it, thought I had seen it before, but could not be certain, as I had only been here in the summer, when everything looked quite different.  
能见度改善了，夜还暗，但雪停了。我看到陡峭的山丘上一座城堡的遗迹。没什么留存了，只有一座塔，它损毁了，空洞的窗洞像黑色的张开的嘴。这地方稍微有点熟悉，是我有点印象的某种东西的扭曲。我认出来了好像，虽然我之前见过，但不能确定，毕竟我只在夏天来过，那时一切都显得不同。

At that time, when I accepted the man’s invitation, I suspected him of an ulterior motive in asking me. He was a painter, not serious, a dilettante; one of those people who always have plenty of money without appearing to do any work. Possibly he had a private income: but I suspected him of being something other than what he seemed. The warmth of my reception surprised me, he could not have been more friendly. All the same, I was on my guard.  
那时，当我接受了那个男人的邀请，我怀疑过他不可告人的动机。他是个画家，不是正经的，是业余的；那种总是有大量财富却从未工作的人。也许他有私人的收入：但我觉得他表里如一。我惊诧于他温暖的接待，他很友好。同样，我有所戒备。

The girl hardly spoke, stood beside him, glancing sideways at me with big eyes through her long lashes. Her presence affected me strongly, although I scarcely knew in what way. I found it difficult to talk to the two of them. The house was in the middle of a beech wood, so closely surrounded by many tall trees that we seemed to be actually in the treetops, waves of dense green foliage breaking outside every window. I thought of an almost extinct race of large singing lemurs known as the Indris, living in the forest trees of a remote tropical island. The gentle affectionate ways and strange melodious voices of these near-legendary creatures had made a great impression on me, and I began speaking about them, forgetting myself in the fascination of the subject. He appeared interested. She said nothing, and presently left us to see about lunch. The conversation at once became easier when she had gone.  
女孩基本没说话，站在他身边，长长的睫毛后大大的眼睛左右打量着我。她的存在深刻地影响着我，虽然我不知道是以何种方式。我发现我很难对他们两个说话。房子处在山毛榉林中央，如此近地被许多高树环绕，仿佛我们处在树梢，绿叶的浪打在每扇窗户前。我想到了一种几乎已经绝迹的会唱歌的狐猴大型，它们被称为 "印第斯"，生活在一个偏远热带岛屿的森林里。这些近乎传说中的动物以它们温柔多情的生活方式和奇特悠扬的声音给我留下了深刻的印象，我开始谈论它们，在话题的魅力中忘我。他似乎很感兴趣。她什么也没说，就离开我们去吃午饭了。她走后，我们的谈话立刻变得轻松起来。

It was midsummer, the weather was very hot, the rustling leaves just outside made a pleasant cool sound. The man’s friendliness continued. I seemed to have misjudged him, and began to be embarrassed by my suspicions. He told me he was glad I had come, and went on to speak of the girl. “She’s terribly shy and nervous, it does her good to see someone from the outside world. She’s too much alone here.” I couldn’t help wondering how much he knew about me, what she had told him. To remain on the defensive seemed rather absurd; still, there was some reservation in my response to his amiable talk.  
那是盛夏，天气很热，外面拂动的树叶发出了怡人的凉爽声音。男人的友好继续着。我似乎误会他了，并且开始为我的怀疑感到尴尬。他告诉我他很高兴我来了，然后继续谈论女孩。“她非常害羞和紧张，对她来说看看外面世界的人有好处。她在这太孤单了。”我不禁思索他有多了解我，她告诉了他什么。继续戒备似乎有些荒谬；然而，我对他的亲切谈话还是有所保留。

I stayed with them for a few days. She kept out of my way. I never saw her unless he was there too. The fine hot weather went on. She wore short, thin, very simple dresses that left her shoulders and arms bare, no stockings, a child’s sandals. In the sunshine her hair dazzled. I knew I would not be able to forget how she looked. I noted a marked change in her, a much increased confidence. She smiled more often, and once in the garden I heard her singing. When the man called her name she came running. It was the first time I had seen her happy. Only when she spoke to me she still showed some constraint. Toward the end of my visit he asked whether I had talked to her alone. I told him I had not. He said: “Do have a word with her before you go. She worries about the past; she’s afraid she made you unhappy.” So he knew. She must have told him all there was to tell. It was not much, certainly. But I would not discuss what had happened with him and said something evasive. Tactfully, he changed the subject: but returned to it later on. “I wish you would set her mind at rest. I shall make an opportunity for you to speak to her privately.” I did not see how he was going to do this, as the next day was the last I would spend with them. I was leaving in the late afternoon.  
我和他们待了几天。她没接近我。我在他不在场的时候没见过她。舒适的热天持续着。她穿着短薄的非常简单的裙子，肩膀和手臂裸露着，没有长袜，一双孩子的凉鞋。在日光中她的头发闪烁着。我知道我永远不会忘记她的样子。我发现她有一个很大的变化，一种逐渐积累的自信。她更常笑了，有一次在花园中我听到她唱歌。当男人叫她的名字时她跑着去。那是我第一次见到她开心。只有当她在和我说话的时候还有所拘束。临近我的拜访结束时他问我有没有和她单独聊过。我说没有。他说：“你临别前没有话要留吗。她担心着过往；她担心她让你不开心了。”所以他知道。她肯定把一切都告诉他了。也没什么，当然。但我不会讨论发生了什么，所以说了些拐弯抹角的话。相应的，他换了话题：但很快又旧事重提。“我希望你能让她安心。我可以给你单独和她聊的机会。”我不知道他打算怎么做，毕竟我和他们就剩最后一天待在一起了。我在第二天下午晚些时候就要走了。

That morning was the hottest there had been. Thunder was in the air. Even at breakfast time the heat was oppressive. To my surprise, they proposed an outing. I was not to leave without having seen one of the local beauty spots. A hill was mentioned, from which there was a celebrated view: I had heard the name. When I referred to my departure I was told it was only a short drive, and that we should be back in plenty of time for me to pack my bag. I saw that they were determined on the arrangement, and agreed.  
那天早晨前所未有地热。雷声响彻云霄。即使是早餐时，也热得让人喘不过气来。令我惊讶的是，他们提议去郊游。如果我没有游览过当地的一处美景，就不让我离开。他们提到了一座小山，从那里可以看到著名的景点： 我听说过。当我提出离开时，他们告诉我只需开一小段路，我们应该有足够的时间回来让我收拾行李。我看到他们很坚决，就同意了。

We took a picnic lunch to eat near the ruins of an old fort, dating from a remote period when there had been fear of invasion. The road ended deep in the woods. We left the car and continued on foot. In the steadily increasing heat, I refused to hurry, dropped behind, and when I saw the end of the trees, sat down in the shade. He came back, pulled me to my feet. “Come along! You’ll see that it’s worth the climb.” His enthusiasm urged me up a steep sunny slope to the summit, where I duly admired the view. Still unsatisfied, he insisted that I must see it from the top of the ruin. He seemed in a queer state, excitable, almost feverish. In the dusty dark, I followed him up steps cut inside the tower wall, his massive figure blocking out the light so that I could see nothing and might have broken my neck where a step was missing. There was no parapet at the top, we stood among heaps of rubble, nothing between us and the drop to the ground, while he swung his arm, pointing out different items in the extensive view. “This tower has been a landmark for centuries. You can see the whole range of hills from here. The sea’s over there. That’s the cathedral spire. The blue line beyond is the estuary.”  
我们在一个古老城堡的废墟附近吃了一顿野餐，这个城堡的历史可以追溯到很久以前，那时人们还担心会有人入侵。路的尽头是一片树林。我们下车继续步行。天气越来越热，我不愿意赶路，被落在后面，看到树林尽头，就在树荫下坐了下来。他回来了，拉我站起来。"走吧！你会发现爬山是值得的。" 在他的热情催促下，我沿着陡峭的斜坡爬上了山顶 在那里我欣赏到了美景。他还是不满意，坚持要我从废墟顶上看。他似乎处于一种奇怪的状态，兴奋得几乎发烧。在尘土飞扬的黑暗中，我跟着他沿着塔墙内侧的台阶往上走，他巨大的身躯挡住了光线，我什么也看不见，差点在少了一级台阶的地方摔断脖子。塔顶没有护栏，我们站在瓦砾堆中，没有任何东西阻挡我们坠落地面，而他则挥舞着手臂，在广阔的视野中指着不同的东西。"这座塔几个世纪以来一直是一个地标。从这里可以看到整个山脉。海就在那边。那是大教堂的尖顶。远处的蓝线就是河口。"

I was more interested in closer details: piles of stones, coils of wire, concrete blocks and other materials for dealing with the coming emergency. Hoping to see something that would provide a clue to the nature of the expected crisis, I went nearer the edge, looked down at the unprotected drop at my feet.  
我对近处的细节更感兴趣：一堆石头，电线线圈，混凝土砖块和其他应对即将来临的危险的材料。我想找到些线索，揭示接下来我觉得会发生的危机的本质，我靠近边缘，向下看向我未经保护的脚。

“Take care!” he warned, laughing. “You could easily slip here, or lose your balance. The perfect spot for a murder, I always think.” His laugh sounded so peculiar that I turned to look at him. He came up to me, saying: “Suppose I give you a little push . . . like this—” I stepped back just in time, but missed my footing and stumbled, staggering on to a crumbling, precarious ledge lower down. His laughing face hung over me, black against the hot sky. “The fall would have been an accident, wouldn’t it? No witnesses. Only my word for what happened. Look how unsteady you are on your feet. Heights seem to affect you.” When we got down to the bottom again I was sweating, my clothes were covered in dust.  
“当心！”他警告道，笑着。“你在这很容易滑倒，或者失去平衡。我总认为这是个完美适合谋杀的地方。”他笑得如此古怪以至于让我转过身看向他。他走向我，说：“也许我轻轻推你一把...像这样—”我及时退后，但脚步慌乱踉跄了几下，踉跄着爬下一级摇摇欲坠岌岌可危的台阶。他的笑脸挂在我头顶，黑色低着热辣的天空。“坠落将会是一场意外，不是吗？没有目击者。只有我的证词。看你脚下多么不稳。高度看起来影响你了。”当我们重回地面我开始流汗，我的衣服被尘土覆盖。

The girl had set out the food on the grass in the shade of an old walnut tree growing there. As usual, she spoke little. I was not sorry my visit was ending; there was too much tension in the atmosphere, her proximity was too disturbing. While we were eating I kept glancing at her, at the silvery blaze of hair, the pale, almost transparent skin, the prominent, brittle wrist-bones. Her husband had lost his earlier exhilaration and become somewhat morose. He took a sketchbook and wandered off. I did not understand his moods. Heavy clouds appeared in the distance; I felt the humidity in the air and knew there would be a storm before long. My jacket lay on the grass beside me; now I folded it into a cushion, propped it against the tree trunk and rested my head on it. The girl was stretched out full length on the grassy bank just below me, her hands clasped over her forehead, shielding her face from the glare. She kept quite still, without speaking, her raised arms displaying the slight roughness and darkness of the shaved armpits, where tiny drops of sweat sparkled like frost. The thin dress she was wearing showed the slight curves of her childish body: I could see that she wore nothing underneath it.  
女孩把食物放在草地上一棵老核桃树的树荫下。像往常一样，她很少说话。我并不为我即将离去而遗憾；气氛太紧张了，她的亲近太令人不安了。我们吃饭的时候，我一直在看她，看她银白的头发，苍白得几乎透明的皮肤，突出而脆弱的腕骨。她的丈夫已经失去了先前的兴致，变得有些消沉。他拿着一本素描本闲散地离开了。我不理解他的心情。远处出现了厚重的乌云；我感觉到了空气中的湿度，知道不久就会有一场暴风雨。我的外套躺在旁边的草地上； 我现在把它折成坐垫，把它靠在树干上头枕着。女孩全身张开在我下面的草岸上，她的手叠在额头上，为脸遮住强光。她还是很安静，没说话，她举起的手臂展示出清理过的腋窝的粗糙和黑色，上面细小的汗珠像霜一样闪着。她穿的薄裙子展示着她孩子是的身体的纤细曲线：我看得出她下面什么也没穿。

She was crouching in front of me, a little lower down the slope, her flesh less white than the snow. Great ice-cliffs were closing in on all sides. The light was fluorescent, a cold flat shadowless icelight. No sun, no shadows, no life, a dead cold. We were in the center of the advancing circle. I had to try to save her. I called: “Come up here—quick!” She turned her head, but without moving, her hair glinting like tarnished silver in the flat light. I went down to her, said: “Don’t be so frightened. I promise I’ll save you. We must get to the top of the tower.” She seemed not to understand, perhaps did not hear because of the rumbling roar of the approaching ice. I got hold of her, pulled her up the slope: it was easy, she was almost weightless. Outside the ruin I stopped, holding her with one arm, looked round and saw at once that it was useless to go any higher. The tower was bound to fall; it would collapse, and be pulverized instantly under millions of tons of ice. The cold scorched my lungs, the ice was so near. She was shivering violently, her shoulders were ice already; I held her closer to me, wrapped both arms round her tight.  
她在我面前弓着身子，在坡稍微低处，她的血肉稍稍不如雪那么白。巨大的冰崖从四面八方合上。光是荧光，一种冷冰平淡无影的冰光。没有太阳，没有影子，没有生命，一种死寂的冷。我们在生长的圈层的中心。我必须想办法救她。我喊到：“过来——快点！”她转过她的头，没有动，她的头发像平光下褪色的银。我下去找她，说：“别害怕。我一定会救你的。我们得到塔顶去。”她看起来没明白，也许因为袭来的冰滚动的咆哮没有听到。我抓住她，拉她上了坡：那很简单，她几乎没有重量。在废墟外面我停住了，一只手抱住她，环顾四周意识到再往高处走也没有用。塔要塌了；它将坍塌，并在数百万吨冰块的碾压下瞬间粉身碎骨。寒冷炙烤着我的肺，冰是如此之近。她在剧烈地颤抖，肩膀已经结冰；我把她抱得更紧，两只手紧紧地搂着她。

Little time was left, but at least we would share the same end. Ice had already engulfed the forest, the last ranks of trees were splintering. Her silver hair touched my mouth, she was leaning against me. Then I lost her; my hands could not find her again. A snapped-off tree trunk was dancing high in the sky, hurled up hundreds of feet by the impact of the ice. There was a flash, everything was shaken. My suitcase was lying open, half-packed, on the bed. The windows of my room were still wide open, the curtains streamed into the room. Outside the treetops were streaming, the sky had gone dark. I saw no rain, but thunder still rolled and echoed, and as I looked out lightning flashed again. The temperature had fallen several degrees since morning. I hurried to put on my jacket and shut the window.  
时间所剩无几，但至少我们将同归于尽。冰雪已经吞噬了整个森林，最后一排树木也在劈啪作响。她的银发触到了我的嘴，她靠在我身上。然后我失去了她，我的手再也找不到她了。一根折断的树干在高空飞舞，被冰雪的冲击力抛起数百英尺。刹那间，一切都动摇了。我的行李箱敞开着，一半打包好了，在床上。我房间的窗户仍然大开着，窗帘流进房间。外面的树梢在流水，天空已经暗了下来。我没有看到雨，但雷声仍在滚动和回响，当我向外看时，闪电又在闪烁。从早上到现在，气温已经下降了好几度。我赶紧穿上外套，关上窗户。

I had been following the right road, after all. After running like a tunnel between unpruned hedges that met overhead, it wound through the dark beech wood to end in front of the house. No light was visible. The place looked derelict, uninhabited, like the others I had passed. I sounded the horn several times and waited. It was late, they might be in bed. If she was there I had to see her, and that was all there was to it. After some delay, the man came and let me in. He did not seem pleased to see me this time, which was understandable if I had woken him up. He appeared to be in his dressing-gown.  
我终究走对了路。这条路像一条隧道，在头顶未修剪的围栏之间穿行，然后蜿蜒穿过漆黑的山毛榉林，最后到达房子前面。没有灯光。这个地方看起来很荒凉，没有人居住，就像我经过的其他地方一样。我按了几次喇叭，等待着。天色已晚，他们可能已经上床睡觉了。如果她在那里，我一定要见到她，这就是一切。耽搁了一会儿，那个男人来了，让我进去。他这次见到我似乎并不高兴，如果是我吵醒了他，也是可以理解的。他似乎穿着睡衣。

The house was without electricity. He went first, flashing a torch. I kept my coat on, although the living-room fire gave out some warmth. In the lamplight I was surprised to see how much he had altered while I had been abroad. He looked heavier, harder, tougher; the amiable expression had gone. It was not a dressing-gown he was wearing, but the long overcoat of some uniform, which made him seem unfamiliar. My old suspicions revived; here was someone who was cashing in on the emergency before it had even arrived. His face did not appear friendly. I apologized for coming so late, explaining that I had lost my way. He was in the process of getting drunk. Bottles and glasses stood on a small table. “Well, here’s to your arrival.” There was no cordiality in his manner or in his voice, which had a sardonic tone that was new. He poured me a drink and sat down, the long overcoat draping his knees. I looked for the bulging pocket, the protruding butt, but nothing of the sort was visible under the coat. We sat drinking together. I made conversation about my travels, waiting for the girl to appear. There was no sign of her; not a sound from the rest of the house. He did not mention her, and I could tell that he refrained deliberately by his look of malicious amusement. The room I remembered as charming was now neglected, dirty. Plaster had fallen from the ceiling, there were deep cracks in the walls as from the effect of blast, black patches where rain had seeped in, and with it, the devastation outside. When my impatience became uncontrollable I asked how she was. “She’s dying.” He grinned spitefully at my exclamation. “As we all are.” It was his idea of a joke at my expense. I saw that he meant to prevent our meeting.  
房子没有电。他先走，举着火炬。我穿着大衣，尽管客厅的火送来些许暖意。在灯光中我讶异地发现他在我出国期间变了很多。他看起来更重、更硬朗、更健壮；友好的印象消失了。他没穿着睡衣，而是某种制服的长上衣，这让他看起来很陌生。我之前的疑心又死灰复燃了；某人这是危机到来之前就未雨绸缪。他的脸看着并不友好。我为我的迟到道歉，解释道我迷路了。她醉了。瓶子和杯子放在一张小桌子上。“那么，为你的到来干杯。”在他的声音里没有热诚，有一种新的嘲弄的语调。他给我倒了一杯然后坐下，长长的上衣拖在他的膝盖上。我找寻隆起的口袋，突出的屁股，但诸如此类的东西在大衣下并不见踪影。我们坐着一起喝着。我谈起我的旅途，等待着女孩出现。没有她的迹象；房子的其他地方没有一点声音。他没有提她，我从他恶毒的笑意中看出他在有意回避。我印象中迷人的房间现在被荒废又肮脏。天花板上掉下粉末，暴风的作用下墙上有很深的裂缝，雨水渗入黑色的斑痕，随之而来的外面的破坏。我终于抑制不住不耐烦，问她在哪。“她要死了。”他咧嘴笑看我的惊讶。“我们都是。”他是在故意拿我开玩笑。我看得出他在阻止我们见面。

I needed to see her; it was vital. I said: “I’ll go now and leave you in peace. But could you give me something to eat first? I’ve had nothing since midday.” He went out and in a rough overbearing voice shouted to her to bring food. The destruction outside was contagious and had infected everything, including their relationship, and the appearance of the room. She brought a tray with bread and butter, a plate of ham, and I looked closely to see if her appearance had changed too. She only looked thinner than ever, and more nearly transparent. She was completely silent, and seemed frightened, withdrawn, as she had been when I knew her first. I longed to ask questions, to talk to her alone, but was not given the chance. The man watched us all the time as he went on drinking. Alcohol made him quarrelsome; he got angry when I refused to drink any more, determined to pick a quarrel with me. I knew I ought to go, but my head ached abominably and made me reluctant to move. I kept pressing my hand over my eyes and forehead. Evidently the girl noticed this, for she left the room for a minute, came back with something in the palm of her hand, murmured: “An aspirin for your head.” Like a bully, he shouted: “What are you whispering to him?” Touched by her thought for me, I would have liked to do more than thank her; but his scowl was so vicious that I got up to leave.  
我需要见她，这至关重要。我说 :"我现在就走，让你清静清静 但你能先给我点吃的吗？我从中午开始就没吃过东西。" 他走了出去，用粗鲁霸道的声音喊她拿吃的来。外面的破坏是传染性的，已经感染了一切，包括他们的关系和房间的外观。她端来一个托盘，上面放着面包和黄油，还有一盘火腿，我仔细观察她的外表是否也发生了变化。她只是看起来比以前更瘦了，更接近透明了。她完全沉默不语，似乎很害怕，很孤僻，就像我第一次认识她时一样。我很想问问题，渴望和她单独交谈，但没有机会。那个男人一边喝酒，一边一直注视着我们。酒精让他变得暴躁易怒；当我拒绝再喝酒时，他生气了，一心想和我吵架。我知道我该走了，但我的头痛得要命，让我不愿动弹。我不停地用手捂住眼睛和额头。显然女孩注意到了这一点，因为她离开了房间一分钟，回来时手里拿着东西，喃喃地说："为你的头痛，吃一片阿司匹林。" 他像个恶霸一样喊道 ："你在跟他说什么悄悄话？" 她为我着想的举动感动了我，我本想向她道谢，但他的咒骂太恶毒了，我只好起身离开。

He did not come to see me off. I felt my way through the darkness by walls and furniture, faced a pale shimmer of snow when I opened the outer door. It was so cold that I hurriedly shut myself in the car and put on the heater. Looking up from the dashboard, I heard her call softly something of which I caught only the words “promise” and “don’t forget.” I switched on the headlights, saw her in the doorway, thin arms clasped round her chest. Her face wore its victim’s look, which was of course psychological, the result of injuries she had received in childhood; I saw it as the faintest possible hint of bruising on the extremely delicate, fine, white skin in the region of eyes and mouth. It was madly attractive to me in a certain way. I had barely caught sight of it now before the car began moving; I was automatically pressing the starter, not expecting it to work in the freezing cold. At the same moment, in what I took for an optical delusion, the black interior of the house prolonged itself into a black arm and hand, which shot out and grasped her so violently that her shocked white face cracked to pieces and she tumbled into the dark.  
他没有来送我。我在黑暗中靠墙壁和家具摸索着前进，当我打开外面的门时，面对的是一片苍白的雪花。天气非常寒冷，我急忙把自己关进车里，打开了暖气。从仪表盘上抬起头，我听到她在轻声呼唤什么，我只听清了 "承诺"和 "别忘了 "两个词。我打开车灯，看到她站在门口，瘦弱的双臂抱在胸前。她的脸上带着受害者的表情，这当然是心理因素造成的，是她童年时受过伤的结果；我看到的是，在她的眼睛和嘴巴周围极其细腻、精致、白皙的皮肤上，有一丝非常微弱的瘀伤。这在某种程度上疯狂地吸引着我。我还没来得及看清楚，车就开动了；我自动按下了启动器，没想到它在这冰天雪地里还能工作。就在同一时刻，在我以为是视觉错觉的情况下，黑色的房屋内部延伸出一只黑色的手臂和手掌，猛地伸出来抓住了她，她惊恐的惨白的脸顿时变得支离破碎，她跌入了黑暗之中。

I could not get over the deterioration in their relationship. While she was happy I had dissociated myself, been outside the situation. Now I felt implicated, involved with her again.  
我无法接受他们关系的恶化。在她高兴的时候，我已经脱离了她，置身事外。现在，我觉得自己被牵连了，又和她卷在了一起。
