## NINE

I asked to be taken to the warden. He had lately moved his headquarters to a different town. An armored car drove me there; two soldiers with submachine guns came too, “for my protection.” It was still raining. We crashed through the downpour under heavy black clouds which shut out the last of the day. Darkness was falling as we entered the town. The headlights showed the familiar scene of havoc, rubble, ruins, blank spaces, all glistening in rain. The streets were full of troops. The least damaged buildings were used as barracks.  
我请求被带去见守卫者。他最近把总部搬到了另一个城镇。一辆装甲车把我送到那里；两名携带冲锋枪的士兵也一同前往，“为了保护我”。雨仍在下。我们在瓢泼大雨中行驶，头顶是厚重的黑云，遮住了最后一丝白昼。当我们进入城镇时，天色已渐暗。车灯照亮了熟悉的破坏景象，废墟、瓦砾、空地，在雨中闪闪发光。街道上挤满了士兵，破坏最少的建筑被用作了军营。

I was taken into a heavily guarded place and left in a small room where two men were waiting. The three of us were alone: they stared at me, but said nothing. We waited in silence. There was only the sound of the rain beating down outside. They sat together on one bench; I, wrapped in my coat, on another. That was all the furniture in the room, which had not been cleaned. Thick dust lay over everything.  
我被带到一个戒备森严的地方，被留在一间小房间里，那里有两个男人在等我。我们三人独处，他们盯着我看，但什么也没说。我们默默等待着，只有外面雨水拍打的声音。他们并排坐在一条长凳上；我则裹着大衣坐在另一条长凳上。这是房间里唯一的家具，房间未曾打扫，厚厚的灰尘覆盖在一切之上。

After a while they began to converse in whispers. I gathered that they had come about some post that was vacant. I stood up, started pacing backward and forward. I was restless, but knew I should have to wait. I was not listening to what the others were saying, but one raised his voice so that I had to hear. He was certain that he would get the job. He boasted: “I’ve been trained to kill with my hands. I can kill the strongest man with three fingers. I’ve learned the points in the body where you can kill easily. I can break a block of wood with the side of my hand.” His words depressed me. This was the kind of man who was wanted now. The two were presently called to an interview and I was left waiting alone. I was prepared to have to wait a long time.  
过了一会儿，他们开始低声交谈。我了解到，他们是为了某个空缺的职位而来的。我站起来，开始来回踱步。我很焦躁，但知道自己必须等待。我并没有在听他们说什么，但其中一个人提高了声音，不得不让我听到。他确信自己会得到这份工作。他自吹自擂道：“我受过徒手杀人的训练。我可以用三根手指杀死最强壮的人。我知道身体上哪些地方可以轻易致命。我可以用手侧劈断一块木头。”他的话让我感到沮丧。如今需要的就是这种人。随后，那两人被叫去面试了，我则独自留下，继续等待。我已经做好了等待很长时间的准备。

It was not so long before a guard came to conduct me to the officers’ mess. The warden was sitting at the head of the high table. Other long tables were more crowded. I was to sit at his table, but not near him, at the far end. We should be too far apart to talk comfortably. Before taking my seat, I went up to salute him. He looked surprised and did not return my greeting. I noticed all the men sitting round immediately leaned together and began speaking in undertones, glancing furtively at me. I seemed to have made an unfavorable impression. I had assumed he would remember me, but he appeared not to know who I was. To remind him of our former connection might make things worse, so I sat down in my distant place.  
不久，一名卫兵来接我前往军官休息室。守卫者坐在高桌的首位。其他长桌上座位更加拥挤。我被安排坐在他的桌子上，但不靠近他，而是在远端。我们相隔太远，无法舒适地交谈。在坐下之前，我走上前去向他行礼。他显得惊讶，没有回礼。我注意到所有围坐的人立刻靠拢在一起，低声交谈，偷偷瞥向我。我似乎给他们留下了不好的印象。我本以为他会记得我，但他似乎不知道我是谁。提醒他我们以前的联系可能会让情况变得更糟，所以我坐在了远处的位置。

I could hear him talking amiably to the officers near him. Their conversation was of arrests and escapes. I was not interested until he told the story of his own flight, involving a big car, a snowstorm, crashing frontier gates, bullets, a girl. He never once looked in my direction or took any notice of me.  
我能听到他和他身边的军官们愉快地交谈。他们的话题是逮捕和逃脱。我对此并不感兴趣，直到他讲述了自己的逃亡故事，涉及一辆大车、暴风雪、冲破边境门、子弹和一个女孩。他从未朝我的方向看过去，也没有注意到我。

From time to time troops could be heard marching past outside. Suddenly there was an explosion. Part of the ceiling collapsed and the lights went out. Hurricane lamps were brought and put on the table. They showed fragments of plaster lying among the dishes. The food was ruined, uneatable, covered in dust and debris. It was taken away. A long and tedious wait followed; then finally bowls of hard-boiled eggs were put down in front of us. Intermittent explosions continued to shake the building, a haze of whitish dust hung in the air, everything was gritty to touch.  
外面不时传来军队行进的声音。突然，发生了一声爆炸，部分天花板塌落，灯光熄灭。风灯被拿来，放在桌上。灯光照出一片石膏碎片散落在盘子间，食物被毁，覆满了灰尘和瓦砾，无法食用，被撤了下去。接着是一段漫长而乏味的等待，最后端上来的只有一碗碗煮得很硬的鸡蛋。爆炸声时断时续，震动着整栋建筑，一片白色的尘雾弥漫在空气中，所有东西摸起来都满是砂砾。

The warden was playing a game of surprising me. He beckoned at the end of the meal. “I enjoyed your broadcasts. You have a gift for that sort of thing.” I was astonished that he knew of the work I had been doing. His voice was friendly, he spoke to me as an equal, and just for a moment I felt identified with him in an obscure sort of intimacy. He went on to say I had timed my arrival well. “Our transmitter will soon be in operation, and yours will be put out of action.” I had always told the authorities we needed a more powerful installation; that it was only a question of time before the existing apparatus was jammed by a stronger one. He assumed that I had heard this was about to happen, and had defected accordingly. He wanted me to broadcast propaganda for him, which I agreed to do, if he would do something for me. “Still the same thing?” “Yes.” He looked at me in amusement, but suspicion flashed in his eyes. Nevertheless he remarked casually, “Her room’s on the floor above; we may as well pay her a visit,” and led the way out. But when I said, “I have to deliver a personal message; could I see her alone?” he did not reply.  
守卫者似乎在玩一种让人惊讶的游戏。餐后，他向我招手：“我很喜欢你的广播节目，你在这方面确实有天赋。”我惊讶于他竟然知道我所做的工作。他的语气很友好，和我平等交谈，就在那一刻，我感到与他有一种模糊的亲近感。他接着说我到得正是时候：“我们的发射台很快就会投入运行，而你们的将会被停用。”我一直对当局说，我们需要一个更强大的设施，现在的设备迟早会被更强的发射台干扰。他以为我是听说了这即将发生的事而叛逃过来的。他希望我为他广播宣传，而我同意了，但条件是他要为我做件事。“还是那件事？”“是的。”他带着玩味的神情看着我，但眼中闪过一丝怀疑。尽管如此，他还是随意地说：“她的房间在楼上，我们可以顺便去看看。”然后带我走出房间。但当我说“我有一个私人信息要传达，能否让我单独见她？”时，他没有作出回应。

We went down one passage, up some stairs and along another. The beam of his powerful torch played on floors littered with rubbish. Footprints showed in the dust; I looked among them for her smaller prints. He opened a door into a dimly lit room. She jumped up. Her white startled face; big eyes staring at me under glittering hair. “You again!” She stood rigid, held the chair in front of her as for protection, hands clenched on the back, knuckles standing out white. “What do you want?” “Only to talk to you.” Looking from one of us to the other, she accused: “You’re in league together.” I denied it: although in a strange way there seemed to be some truth in the charge . . . “Of course you are. He wouldn’t bring you here otherwise.”  
我们沿着一条走廊走下去，上了楼梯，又沿另一条走廊走过去。他那支强力手电的光束在堆满垃圾的地板上晃动。灰尘中显现出脚印；我在其中寻找她那较小的脚印。他推开一扇门，进入一间昏暗的房间。她突然跳了起来。她的脸苍白惊恐，大眼睛在闪亮的头发下直直地盯着我。“又是你！”她僵硬地站着，双手紧握着椅背，关节因为用力显得苍白，仿佛在借此来保护自己。“你想干什么？”“只是想和你谈谈。”她看看我们俩，指责道：“你们是同伙。”我否认了，尽管奇怪的是，她的指责似乎有几分道理……“当然是，你们要不然他不会带你来这里。”

The warden approached her, smiling. I had never seen him look so benevolent. “Come now, that’s not a very kind way to greet an old friend. Can’t we all have a friendly talk? You’ve never told me how you first got to know each other.” It was clear that he had no intention of leaving us alone. I gazed at her silently, could not talk to her in front of him. His personality was too dominant, his influence too strong. In his presence she was frightened, antagonistic. Barriers were created. I was distracted myself. No wonder he smiled. I might as well not have found her. A distant explosion shook the walls; she watched the white dust float down from the ceiling. For the sake of saying something, I asked if the bombing disturbed her. Her face blank, her bright hair shimmering, she silently moved her head in a way that meant anything, nothing.  
守卫者走近她，微笑着。我从未见过他如此和善的样子。“别这样，这不是对待老朋友的好方式。我们不能好好聊聊吗？你从没告诉过我你们是怎么认识的。”显然，他没有离开我们独处的打算。我默默地注视着她，无法在他面前和她交谈。他的个性太强，影响力太大。在他面前，她显得害怕和对立。隔阂因此而生。我自己也分心了，难怪他笑得那么得意。我找到她也等于没找到。一声遥远的爆炸震动了墙壁；她看着白色的灰尘从天花板上飘落。为了说点什么，我问轰炸是否打扰了她。她面无表情，明亮的头发闪烁着光泽，默默地摇了摇头，那种姿态既可以代表任何意思，也可以毫无意义。

The warden said: “I’ve tried to persuade her to go to a safer place, but she refuses to leave.” He smiled complacently, showing me his power over her. I found it hard to accept. I looked round the room: the chair, a small mirror, a bed, paperbacks on the table, dust everywhere, fallen plaster thick on the floor. Her gray loden coat hung from a hook. I saw no other personal belongings except a comb and a square of chocolate in torn silver paper. I turned away from the man and addressed her directly, trying to speak as if he was not there. “You don’t seem very comfortable here. Why not go to a hotel, somewhere further away from the fighting?” She did not answer, shrugged her shoulders slightly. A silence followed.  
守卫者说：“我试过劝她去个更安全的地方，但她不肯离开。”他满脸自满地笑着，向我炫耀他对她的控制。我很难接受这种情况。我环顾四周：椅子、一面小镜子、一张床、桌子上的平装书、到处都是灰尘，地板上厚厚的掉落石膏。她的灰色罗登大衣挂在一个挂钩上。我没有看到其他个人物品，除了一个梳子和一块包装破损的银纸包裹的巧克力。我转过身来，不理会那个男人，直接对她说，尽量不让他影响我：“你在这里看起来不怎么舒服，为什么不去旅馆，离战斗远一点的地方？”她没有回答，微微耸了耸肩。接下来是沉默。

Troops marched past under the window. He went across, opened the shutters a crack and looked down. I muttered hurriedly, “I only want to help you,” moved my hand toward hers, which was snatched back. “I don’t trust you. I don’t believe a word you say.” Her eyes were wide and defiant. I knew I would never succeed in making contact with her while he was in the room. Nothing was to be gained by staying longer. I left.  
军队从窗下经过。他走到窗前，打开了百叶窗的一条缝隙，往下看。我匆匆低声说：“我只想帮助你。”我把手伸向她，她却迅速缩回。“我不信你，我不信你说的每一个字。”她眼睛瞪得大大的，满是抗拒。我知道在他在房间里时，我永远无法和她建立联系。再待下去也无济于事。我离开了。

Outside the door, I heard his laugh, his step on the floorboards, his voice: “What have you got against that one?” Then her voice, changed, blurred with tears, high pitched, hysterical. “He’s a liar. I know he’s working with you. You’re both the same, selfish, treacherous, cruel. I wish I’d never met either of you, I hate you both! One day I’ll go . . . you won’t see me again . . . ever!” I walked on down the passage, stumbling over the rubble, kicking it aside. I had not thought of providing myself with a torch.  
在门外，我听到了他的笑声，脚步声在地板上回荡，他的声音响起：“你对那个家伙有什么意见？”然后是她的声音，变得模糊，带着泪水，高亢而歇斯底里。“他是个骗子，我知道他和你是一伙的。你们俩都是一样的，自私、背信弃义、残忍。我真希望从来没有认识过你们两个，我恨你们两个！总有一天我会离开……你们再也不会见到我……永远！”我沿着走廊走下去，踉跄着踩在瓦砾上，把它们踢到一边。我没想到要带上手电筒。

For the next few days I considered taking her away from him to a neutral country. Theoretically it was quite possible. Occasional ships still called at the local port. It was a matter of speed, secrecy and exact timing. Success depended on getting to sea before we were followed. I began making cautious inquiries. The answers could be bought. The difficulty was that no one could be trusted. The person I was paying for information might sell my questions to somebody in the warden’s pay. This made the whole thing highly dangerous. I was nervous; I could not afford to take such risks; nevertheless, the risk had to be run.  
接下来的几天里，我一直在考虑把她从他那里带走，去一个中立的国家。从理论上讲，这是完全可能的。偶尔还有船只会停靠在当地的港口。问题在于速度、保密和准确的时机。成功的关键在于在被追踪之前逃到海上。我开始小心翼翼地打听消息。答案是可以买到的，问题是没有人值得信任。我向某人支付情报费用，而他可能会把我的问题卖给在守卫者手下工作的人。这使得整个事情变得极其危险。我很紧张，我不能承担这样的风险；尽管如此，风险还是必须冒的。

Voices whispered secrets: names, addresses, destinations, departures. “Go to . . . ask for . . . hold yourself in instant readiness . . . documents . . . proof . . . ample funds . . .” I needed to speak to her before taking my plans a stage further. I went to her room, heard a shot, paid no attention; shooting was going on in the streets all the time. The man emerged, shut the door behind him. I said I wanted to see her. “You can’t.” He turned the key, dropped it into his pocket, threw a pistol down on the table. “She’s dead.” A knife went through me. All other deaths in the world were outside; this one was in my body, like a bayonet, like my own. “Who killed her?” Only I could do that. When he said, “I did,” my hand moved, touched the gun, the barrel was hot. I could have seized it and shot him. It would have been easy. He made no move to prevent me, stood motionless, gazing at me. I looked back at him, at his face with its arrogant bone structure; our eyes met.  
耳边传来低语声：名字、地址、目的地、出发时间。“去……找……保持随时待命……文件……证明……足够的资金……”我需要在进一步执行计划之前先和她谈谈。我来到她的房间，听到一声枪响，没有在意；街上经常有枪声响起。一个男人从房间里走出来，关上门。我说我想见她。“你不能见她。”他转动钥匙，将其放进口袋，把一把手枪扔在桌上。“她死了。”一阵剧痛贯穿我的全身。世上所有的其他死亡都是外在的，唯有这一次，像刺刀一样，像我自己的死一样，深深刺入了我的体内。“谁杀了她？”除了我，没人能做得出来。他说“我杀的”时，我的手下意识地摸向枪支，枪管还是热的。我本可以拿起枪朝他开枪，这很容易。他没有阻止我，静静地站着，目光盯着我。我回视着他，看着他那张傲慢的脸，骨骼分明；我们的目光在空中相遇。

In an indescribable way our looks tangled together. I seemed to be looking at my own reflection. Suddenly I was entangled in utmost confusion, not sure which of us was which. We were like halves of one being, joined in some mysterious symbiosis. I fought to retain my identity, but all my efforts failed to keep us apart. I continually found I was not myself, but him. At one moment I actually seemed to be wearing his clothes. I fled from the room in utter confusion: afterward did not know what had happened, or if anything had.  
我们的目光在一种难以言喻的方式中纠缠在一起，我仿佛在看自己的倒影。突然之间，我陷入了极度的混乱，不确定我们俩到底谁是谁。我们就像一个整体的两半，以某种神秘的方式共生在一起。我拼命地试图保持自己的身份，但所有的努力都无法将我们分开。我不停地发现自己不再是我自己，而是他。有一刻，我甚至觉得自己穿着他的衣服。我在极度的混乱中逃离了房间，之后不清楚到底发生了什么，或者说，是否真的发生了什么。

On another occasion he met me at the door of the room, said at once: “You’re too late. The bird’s flown.” He was grinning, his face wore an expression of naked malice. “She’s gone. Run away. Disappeared.” My fists clenched. “You sent her away so that I shouldn’t see her. You’ve deliberately kept us apart.” I started toward him in fury. Then again our looks tangled, confusion came back; a wider confusion, not of identity only, but also of time and place. Cold blue eyes flashing, the blue flash of a ring, curved cold strangler’s fingers. He had fought bears and strangled them with his hands. Physically I was no match . . . As I left, I heard his voice jeering: “That’s more sensible.”  
另一次他在房门口等我，一见面就说：“你来晚了，小鸟已经飞走了。”他咧嘴笑着，脸上带着赤裸裸的恶意表情。“她已经走了，逃跑了，消失了。”我握紧拳头，“你故意把她送走，不让我见她。你刻意让我们分开。”我愤怒地朝他冲过去。然后我们的目光再次纠缠在一起，混乱感再次涌上心头，这种混乱不仅仅是身份的错乱，还有时间和空间的错乱。冰冷的蓝眼睛闪着光，戒指的蓝色闪光，弯曲的冷酷的勒杀者的手指。他曾与熊搏斗，并用双手将它们勒死。我在体力上根本不是他的对手……离开时，我听见他的嘲笑声：“这才明智。”

I went into an empty room. I needed time in which to collect myself. I was disturbed, I longed for the girl, could not bear to have lost her. I thought of the journey I had been planning with her beside me, which would now never take place. My face was wet as with rain, drops ran down into my mouth, tasted salt. I covered my eyes with my handkerchief, brought myself under control by a violent effort.  
我走进了一间空房间。我需要时间来平复心情。我感到心烦意乱，渴望着那个女孩，无法忍受失去她的痛苦。我想着原本计划与她一同进行的旅程，而现在这一切都不会发生了。我的脸像被雨水打湿了，泪水滴进了嘴里，带着咸味。我用手帕捂住眼睛，费了很大力气才让自己恢复冷静。

I should have to start searching for her all over again. The repetition was like a curse. I thought of placid blue seas, tranquil islands, far away from war. I thought of the Indris, those happy creatures, symbols of life in peace, on a higher plane. I could clear out, go to them. No, that was impossible. I was tied to her. I thought of the ice moving across the world, casting its shadow of creeping death. Ice cliffs boomed in my dreams, indescribable explosions thundered and boomed, icebergs crashed, hurled huge boulders into the sky like rockets. Dazzling ice stars bombarded the world with rays, which splintered and penetrated the earth, filling earth’s core with their deadly coldness, reinforcing the cold of the advancing ice. And always, on the surface, the indestructible ice-mass was moving forward, implacably destroying all life. I felt a fearful sense of pressure and urgency, there was no time to lose, I was wasting time; it was a race between me and the ice. Her albino hair illuminated my dreams, shining brighter than moonlight. I saw the dead moon dance over the icebergs, as it would at the end of our world, while she watched from the tent of her glittering hair.  
我必须重新开始寻找她。这种重复犹如一种诅咒。我想到了宁静的蓝色海洋，平和的岛屿，远离战争的地方。我想到了安静的印德里斯，那些象征和平生活的幸福生物，仿佛生活在更高的境界。我可以离开，去找他们。不，那是不可能的。我被她束缚着。我想到了冰雪逐渐覆盖世界，投下缓慢死亡的阴影。梦中冰崖轰鸣，无法形容的爆炸声响彻四方，冰山撞击，巨大的岩石像火箭般被抛向天空。耀眼的冰星以光束轰击世界，这些光束分裂并穿透地球，填满地心的致命寒气，助长了推进的冰川的寒冷。始终，在地表上，那无坚不摧的冰雪大军正向前推进，毫不留情地摧毁一切生命。我感到一种恐惧的压力和紧迫感，时间所剩无几，我在浪费时间；这是一场我与冰川的竞赛。她那如雪的头发在梦中照亮，比月光还要明亮。我看见死寂的月亮在冰山上起舞，仿佛在我们的世界末日时，而她则在那闪亮的头发帐篷里静静观看。

I dreamed of her whether I was asleep or awake. I heard her cry: “One day I’ll go . . . you won’t see me again . . .” She had gone from me already. She had escaped. She hurried along a street in an unknown town. She looked different, less anxious, more confident. She knew exactly where she was going, she did not hesitate once. In a huge official building she made straight for a room so crowded she could hardly open the door. Only her extreme slimness enabled her to slip between the many tall silent figures, unnaturally silent, fantastically tall, whose faces were all averted from her. Her anxiety started to come back when she saw them towering over her, surrounding her like dark trees. She felt small and lost among them, quickly became afraid. Her confidence had vanished; it had never been real. Now she only wanted to escape from that place: her eyes darted from side to side, saw no door, no way out. She was trapped. The faceless black treeforms pressed closer, extended arm-branches, imprisoning her. She looked down, but was still imprisoned. Filled trouser-legs, solid tree trunks, stood all around. The floor had become dark earth, full of roots and boles. Quickly looking up at the window, she saw only white weaving meshes of snow, shutting out the world. The known world excluded, reality blotted out, she was alone with threatening nightmare shapes of trees or phantoms, tall as firs growing in snow.  
无论我醒着还是睡着，都会梦见她。我听到她在喊：“总有一天我会走……你再也不会见到我……”她已经离开了我。她逃走了。她匆匆走在一个陌生的城镇街头，看上去不同了，少了些焦虑，多了些自信。她清楚地知道自己要去哪儿，从未有片刻犹豫。在一座庞大的办公楼里，她径直走向一间挤满人的房间，几乎无法打开门。只有她极端纤细的身材使她能够在众多高大、沉默的身影之间滑过，这些身影都异常沉默，令人难以置信地高大，脸全都转向一边，没有看她。当她看到这些高大的身影在她身边矗立，如黑暗的树木将她包围时，她的焦虑开始回来了。她感到渺小和迷失，很快就害怕了起来。她的自信消失了；那从来不是真的。现在她只想逃离那个地方：她的目光四处游移，没有看到门，没有看到出口。她被困住了。没有脸的黑色树形身影逼近，伸出手臂般的树枝，将她禁锢住。她低头看，依旧被困住。那些充满的裤腿，犹如坚实的树干，立在四周。地板变成了黑暗的泥土，满是树根和树瘤。她迅速抬头看向窗户，只看到白色的雪花编织成的网，遮蔽了整个世界。已知的世界被排除在外，现实被抹去了，她与那些威胁性的梦魇般的树木或幽灵独处，宛如在雪地里生长的冷杉般高大。

Global conditions were worsening. There was no sign of destruction coming to a halt, and its inexorable progress induced general demoralization. It was more impossible than ever to find out what was really happening, impossible to know what to believe. No reliable source of information existed. Very little news of any description came from abroad; none whatsoever from once-prominent states which had simply dropped out of existence. More than any other single factor, it was the implacable spread of these unnerving areas of total silence that undermined public morale.  
全球局势日益恶化，破坏的迹象丝毫没有停止，其不可阻挡的进程引发了普遍的士气低落。了解真实情况变得比以往更加困难，甚至无法确定该相信什么。没有任何可靠的信息来源。来自国外的消息寥寥无几，曾经显赫的国家已完全消失，毫无音讯。更甚于其他任何因素，这些令人不安的沉寂地区的无情扩张最为打击公众士气。

In certain countries civil unrest had resulted in the army taking command. A worldwide swing toward militarism had taken place during recent months, with deplorable and brutalizing effects. Frequent clashes occurred between civilians and the armed forces. The killing of police and soldiers, with retributory executions, had become commonplace.  
在某些国家，国内动乱导致军队接管了政权。近几个月来，全球范围内出现了向军事化转变的趋势，其后果令人遗憾且残酷。平民与武装力量之间频繁发生冲突。杀害警察和士兵，以及随之而来的报复性处决，已变得司空见惯。

As was to be expected, in the absence of any genuine news, fantastic rumors kept circulating. Monstrous epidemics, appalling famines, were said to have broken out in remote districts, fearsome deviations to have occurred from the genetic norm. Stocks of thermonuclear weapons, previously supposed to have been destroyed, were periodically reported to be in the possession of this or that power. Persistent rumors concerned the existence of a self-detonating cobalt bomb, timed, at a preset, unknown moment, to destroy all life, while leaving inanimate objects intact. Spying and counter-spying went on everywhere. There were growing acute shortages in all countries, food riots followed as a matter of course. The lawless element in the population was much in evidence, decent people were terrorized. The death penalty imposed for looting had little or no effect as a deterrent.  
正如所预料的那样，由于缺乏真正的新闻，奇异的谣言不断流传。有人说在偏远地区爆发了可怕的瘟疫和饥荒，基因异常的恐怖变异频繁出现。此前被认为已经销毁的热核武器库存，时不时传出被某个势力掌握的消息。关于一种自爆钴弹的存在也持续传闻不断，这种武器据称在预设的未知时刻将摧毁所有生命，而使无生命的物体完好无损。间谍活动和反间谍活动在各地蔓延。各国普遍出现严重的物资短缺，随之而来的食物骚乱屡见不鲜。人口中的无赖分子十分猖獗，体面的人们饱受恐吓。虽然掠夺行为被判处死刑，但作为威慑几乎没有效果。

I got news of the girl indirectly. She was alive, in a certain town, in another country. I was almost sure the place was in the area of immediate danger, although there was no means of checking the point, since all reference to the advancing ice was forbidden. By intense persistence and extensive bribery, I managed to board a ship traveling in that direction. The captain wanted to make money fast, and for a large sum agreed to put in at the port I named.  
我间接地得到了关于那个女孩的消息。她还活着，在另一个国家的某个城镇。我几乎可以确定这个地方正处于迫在眉睫的危险区域，尽管没有办法核实这一点，因为所有关于冰层推进的消息都被禁止传播。经过执着的努力和大规模的贿赂，我终于设法登上一艘前往那个方向的船。船长急于快速赚钱，收了我一大笔钱后，同意在我指定的港口靠岸。

We arrived. It was early morning, unbelievably cold, dark when it should have been light. No sky, no clouds, they were hidden by falling snow. It was not a morning like other mornings, but what it was: an unnatural freezing of day into darkness, spring into arctic winter. I went to say good-bye to the captain, who asked if I had changed my mind about going ashore. I said I had not. “Then for God’s sake get going. Don’t keep us hanging about.” He was angry, antagonistic. We parted without more words.  
我们抵达了那里。清晨，寒冷得难以置信，本该是明亮的却一片黑暗。天空和云朵都被纷纷飘落的雪花遮蔽。这并不是普通的清晨，而是一种不自然的白昼冻结成黑夜，春天冻结成北极寒冬。我去向船长告别，他问我是否改变了上岸的主意。我说没有。“那就快走吧，别让我们久等。”他满是愤怒和敌意，我们没有再多说什么就分开了。

I went on deck with the first officer. The air stung like acid. It was the breath of ice, of the polar regions, almost unbreathable. It scarified the skin, seared the lungs; but the body quickly adjusted itself to this stringency. The density of the snow created a curious fog-like gloom in the upper air. Everything was obscured by the small flakes falling ceaselessly out of the shrouded sky. The cold scalded my hands when I collided with iced-up parts of the ship’s superstructure, which only became visible when it was too late to avoid them. In the silence I noticed a rhythmic vibration below, and spoke to my escort: “The engines; they haven’t stopped.” For some reason it seemed surprising. “You bet they haven’t. The skipper can’t wait to turn the ship round. He’s been cursing you for days for making us put in here.” The man showed the same antagonism as the captain, plus a disagreeable curiosity which came out now. “Why the devil have you come, anyhow?” “That’s my business.” In unfriendly silence we reached the rail. It was cased in thick ice, a rope ladder dangling from it toward the sound of a motor running below. Before I had time to look down, he swung his leg over. “Harbor’s frozen. We’ve got to put you ashore by launch.” While he quickly descended with practiced ease, I followed more awkwardly, clinging on with both hands, blinded by the snow. I did not see who pulled me into the rocking launch, or who pushed me toward a seat, as it immediately shot forward. Traveling at full speed, it plunged and reared continually like a bucking horse, sheets of spray flew over the roof of the little cabin. There was too much noise for voices to be audible; but I could feel the almost murderous hostility of those on board, all hating me for keeping them here in danger when they might have been on the way to safety. To them my behavior must have seemed perverse and utterly senseless. I began to wonder myself whether it made any sense, sitting huddled up in my coat, in the brutal paralyzing cold.  
我和大副一起走到甲板上。空气像酸一样刺痛着皮肤。这是冰雪的气息，极地的气息，几乎无法呼吸。它划伤了皮肤，灼烧着肺部，但身体很快适应了这种苛刻的环境。密集的雪花在空中形成了一种奇特的雾霾，掩盖了一切。无数小雪片无休止地从被遮蔽的天空中飘落，使得一切都变得模糊。我在寂静中感觉到下方传来的有节奏的震动，于是对我的护送者说道：“引擎还没有停。”这似乎让人感到惊讶。“你说对了。船长急不可耐地想掉头回去，他已经为你让我们在这里停靠骂了好几天了。”这个人表现出和船长一样的敌意，外加一种令人不快的好奇心，现在流露出来了：“你到底为什么来这里？”“那是我的事。”在不友好的沉默中，我们到达了栏杆。它被厚厚的冰层覆盖，绳梯从上面垂下来，通向下方引擎的轰鸣声。我还没来得及往下看，他就已经一脚跨了过去。“港口结冰了。我们得用小艇把你送上岸。”他很快熟练地爬了下去，我则笨拙地跟着，双手紧紧抓住绳梯，被雪弄得看不清方向。我没有看到是谁把我拉进了摇晃的小艇，也没看到是谁把我推向了座位，因为小艇立刻加速前行，像一匹发狂的马不停地上下颠簸。喷射的水幕飞过小舱的顶部。噪音太大，根本听不到说话的声音；但我能感觉到船上几乎杀气腾腾的敌意，他们都恨我把他们留在这个危险的地方，而他们本可以驶向安全之地。对他们来说，我的行为一定显得极其怪异而毫无意义。我自己也开始怀疑这一切是否有意义，在这残酷、令人麻痹的寒冷中，我蜷缩在大衣里。

A sudden long-drawn-out yell startled me; it was really more of a howl. The officer jumped up, shouted back through a megaphone, then resumed his seat with the words: “One-way traffic.” Seeing that I did not understand, he added, “Plenty going the other way,” and pointed ahead.  
突然间，一声悠长的叫喊声把我吓了一跳；实际上那更像是一声嚎叫。大副跳起来，用喇叭喊了回去，然后坐回原位，说了句：“一方通行。”见我不明所以，他又补充道，“对面来的人多得很，”并指了指前方。

A confused indistinct commotion revealed itself as a ship, motionless in the midst of the feverish activity of small boats seething round it. In frantic competition, they fought to get near enough for their occupants to climb aboard. There was not room for all. Spectators crowded the rails of the ship as if at a racecourse, watching the collisions and capsizings below. Those in the boats had probably lived easily and been unaccustomed to danger, for they battled clumsily for their lives, with a sort of headlong terror, wasting their strength in useless jostling and surging. One boat floated upside down, surrounded by frenzied hands and arms struggling out of the water. The people in the next boat swarmed over it, hit out, kicked, stamped on the clinging hands, beat off the drowning. Even the most powerful swimmer could not survive long in that freezing sea. Several of the overcrowded, unskillfully handled boats turned over and sank. Some broke up after colliding. In those that remained afloat, the passengers crushed and trampled each other in senseless panic, drove off clutching swimmers with oars. People already dying were battered and beaten. The muffled uproar of screams, thuds, splashes, continued long after the scene was hidden behind the snow. I recalled polite voices announcing over the air that people were desperate, fighting to get away from the threatened countries to safer regions.  
一阵模糊而混乱的喧嚣揭示了一艘船，它在一群小船的狂乱活动中静止不动。小船们争先恐后地试图靠近大船，好让里面的人爬上去。船上没有足够的空间容纳所有人。观众挤在船舷上，仿佛在观看赛马，俯瞰着下方的碰撞和倾覆。那些在小船上的人或许曾经生活安逸，未曾习惯危险，因此他们为了生存而笨拙地搏斗，带着一种慌乱的恐惧，徒劳地在船上挤来挤去，消耗着自己的力气。一艘小船倒扣在水面，四周是疯狂挣扎着的手臂和手掌。旁边的小船上的人蜂拥而上，拳打脚踢，用力踩踏着紧抓着的手，将快要淹死的人赶开。即便是最强壮的游泳者也无法在这冰冷的海水中坚持太久。几艘过载且操控不当的小船翻覆下沉，有的撞船后破裂。那些仍然漂浮的小船上，乘客们在无谓的惊慌中相互挤压践踏，用桨把抓住船边的游泳者赶走。已经奄奄一息的人被打得遍体鳞伤。呼喊声、撞击声、溅水声闷闷地持续了很久，直到这一切被雪幕遮蔽。我想起了广播中礼貌的声音宣布人们绝望地拼命逃离受威胁的国家，奔向更安全的地区。

The frozen harbor was a gray-white expanse, dotted with black abandoned hulks, embedded immovably in the ice. Banks of solid ice edged the narrow channel of blackish water, fringed with grinning icicle-teeth. I jumped ashore, snow blew out in great fans, the launch disappeared from sight. There were no good-byes.  
冰封的港口是一片灰白色的广阔地带，点缀着嵌在冰中的黑色废弃船只。坚固的冰堤围绕着狭窄的黑水通道，边缘挂满了像牙齿一样的冰柱。我跳上岸，雪花被风吹成巨大的扇形，登岸艇很快就消失在视线之外。没有任何道别。
